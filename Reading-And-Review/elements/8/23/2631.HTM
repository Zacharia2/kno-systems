<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell&#8217;s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he&#8217;d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren&#8217;t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn&#8217;t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn&#8217;t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn&#8217;t have much of a head start.</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What have we got today?&#8221; Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Double Potions with the Slytherins,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Snape&#8217;s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them &#8212; we&#8217;ll be able to see if it&#8217;s true.&#8221;
