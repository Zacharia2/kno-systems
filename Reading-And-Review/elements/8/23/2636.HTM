<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Marge&#8217;s ill,&#8221; he informed Aunt Petunia.&#8220;Ate a funny whelk&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dad!&#8221; said Dudley suddenly. &#8220;Dad,Harry&#8217;s got something!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which waswritten on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it wasjerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>mine</I>!&#8221; said Harry, trying tosnatch it back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who&#8217;d be writing to you?&#8221; sneered UncleVernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.His face went from red to green faster than a set of trafficlights. And it didn&#8217;t stop there. Within seconds it was thegrayish white of old porridge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;P-P-Petunia!&#8221; he gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernonheld it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously andread the first line. For a moment it looked as though she mightfaint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vernon! Oh my goodness &#8212; Vernon!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harryand Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn&#8217;t used tobeing ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with hisSmelting stick.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want to read that letter,&#8221; he said loudly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>I</I> want to read it,&#8221; said Harry furiously,&#8220;as it&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>mine.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get out, both of you,&#8221; croaked Uncle Vernon,stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t move.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I WANT MY LETTER!&#8221; he shouted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let <I class=calibre9>me</I> see it!&#8221; demanded Dudley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;OUT!&#8221; roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harryand Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into thehall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudleypromptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen atthe keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from oneear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between doorand floor.
