<P class=epubfirstparagraph>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother,&#8220;I don&#8217;t <I class=calibre9>want</I> him in there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.I <I class=calibre9>need</I> that room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make him getout.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he&#8217;dhave given anything to be up here. Today he&#8217;d rather be backin his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.</P>
<P class=break>Next morning at breakfast, everyone was ratherquiet. Dudley was in shock. He&#8217;d screamed, whacked his fatherwith his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother,and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he stilldidn&#8217;t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this timeyesterday and bitterly wishing he&#8217;d opened the letter in thehall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each otherdarkly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying tobe nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him bangingthings with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then heshouted, &#8220;There&#8217;s another one! &#8216;Mr. H. Potter,The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive &#8212;&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and randown the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestleDudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was madedifficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon aroundthe neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in whicheveryone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernonstraightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry&#8217;s letterclutched in his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to your cupboard &#8212; I mean, your bedroom,&#8221;he wheezed at Harry. &#8220;Dudley &#8212; go &#8212; justgo.&#8221;
