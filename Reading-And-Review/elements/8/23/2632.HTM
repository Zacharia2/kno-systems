<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wish McGonagall favored us,&#8221; said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn&#8217;t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hedwig hadn&#8217;t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry&#8217;s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:</P>
<DIV class=block>
<DIV class=topbot>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Dear Harry,</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.</P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Hagrid</I></P></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Harry borrowed Ron&#8217;s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he&#8217;d been wrong. Snape didn&#8217;t dislike Harry &#8212; he hated him.
