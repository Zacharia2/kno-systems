<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can&#8217;t blame them,&#8221; said Dumbledoregently. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had precious little to celebrate foreleven years.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall irritably.&#8220;But that&#8217;s no reason to lose our heads. People arebeing downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, noteven dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as thoughhoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn&#8217;t, soshe went on. &#8220;A fine thing it would be if, on the very dayYou-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles foundout about us all. I suppose he really <I class=calibre9>has</I> gone,Dumbledore?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It certainly seems so,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;Wehave much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemondrop?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A <I class=calibre9>what</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A lemon drop. They&#8217;re a kind of Muggle sweetI&#8217;m rather fond of.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall coldly,as though she didn&#8217;t think this was the moment for lemondrops. &#8220;As I say, even if You-Know-Who <I class=calibre9>has</I> gone&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourselfcan call him by his name? All this &#8216;You-Know-Who&#8217;nonsense &#8212; for eleven years I have been trying to persuadepeople to call him by his proper name: <I class=calibre9>Voldemort.</I>&#8221;Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unstickingtwo lemon drops, seemed not to notice. &#8220;It all gets soconfusing if we keep saying &#8216;You-Know-Who.&#8217; I havenever seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort&#8217;sname.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know you haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said ProfessorMcGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. &#8220;Butyou&#8217;re different. Everyone knows you&#8217;re the only oneYou-Know- oh, all right,
