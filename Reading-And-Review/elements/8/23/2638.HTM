<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get the mail, Dudley,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon frombehind his paper.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make Harry get it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get the mail, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make Dudley get it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Threethings lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon&#8217;ssister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brownenvelope that looked like a bill, and &#8212; <I class=calibre9>a letter forHarry.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like agiant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written tohim. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives &#8212; hedidn&#8217;t belong to the library, so he&#8217;d never even gotrude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter,addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:</P>

<P class=noindent>The envelope was thick and heavy, made ofyellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-greenink. There was no stamp.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw apurple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger,and a snake surrounding a large letter <I class=calibre9>H.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hurry up, boy!&#8221; shouted Uncle Vernon from thekitchen. &#8220;What are you doing, checking for letterbombs?&#8221; He chuckled at his own joke.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. Hehanded Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowlybegan to open the yellow envelope.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, andflipped over the postcard.
