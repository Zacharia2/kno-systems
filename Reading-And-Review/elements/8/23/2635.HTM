<I class=calibre9>Voldemort,</I> was frightenedof.&#8221; 
<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You flatter me,&#8221; said Dumbledore calmly.&#8220;Voldemort had powers I will never have.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Only because you&#8217;re too &#8212; well &#8212;<I class=calibre9>noble</I> to use them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky it&#8217;s dark. I haven&#8217;t blushedso much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my newearmuffs.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said,&#8220;The owls are nothing next to the <I class=calibre9>rumors</I> that areflying around. You know what everyone&#8217;s saying? About whyhe&#8217;s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point shewas most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waitingon a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a womanhad she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.It was plain that whatever &#8220;everyone&#8221; was saying, shewas not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did notanswer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What they&#8217;re <I class=calibre9>saying,</I>&#8221; she pressed on,&#8220;is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric&#8217;sHollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily andJames Potter are &#8212; are &#8212; that they&#8217;re &#8212;<I class=calibre9>dead.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Lily and James&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&#8217;t believeit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn&#8217;t want to believeit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, Albus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. &#8220;Iknow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; hesaid heavily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall&#8217;s voice trembled as she went on.&#8220;That&#8217;s not all. They&#8217;re saying he tried to killthe Potters&#8217; son, Harry. But &#8212; he couldn&#8217;t. Hecouldn&#8217;t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, butthey&#8217;re saying that when he couldn&#8217;t kill Harry Potter,Voldemort&#8217;s power somehow broke &#8212; and that&#8217;s whyhe&#8217;s gone.&#8221;
