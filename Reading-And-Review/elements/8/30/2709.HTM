<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ronkicked him behind their cauldron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push it,&#8221; he muttered,&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>As they climbed the steps out of thedungeon an hour later, Harry&#8217;s mind was racing and hisspirits were low. He&#8217;d lost two points for Gryffindor in hisvery first week &#8212; <I class=calibre9>why</I> did Snape hate him so much?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; said Ron, &#8220;Snape&#8217;s alwaystaking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid withyou?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>At five to three they left the castleand made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a smallwooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and apair of galoshes were outside the front door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from insideand several booming barks. Then Hagrid&#8217;s voice rang out,saying, &#8220;<I class=calibre9>Back,</I> Fang &#8212; <I class=calibre9>back.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid&#8217;s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as hepulled the door open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hang on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<I class=calibre9>Back,</I>Fang.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of anenormous black boarhound.</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>There was only one room inside. Hamsand pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle wasboiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bedwith a patchwork quilt over it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make yerselves at home,&#8221; said Hagrid, letting go ofFang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is Ron,&#8221; Harry told Hagrid, who was pouringboiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto aplate.
