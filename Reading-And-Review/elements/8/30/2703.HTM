<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was theonly one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very oldindeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire andgot up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binnsdroned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and gotEmeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizardwho had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At thestart of their first class he took the roll call, and when hereached Harry&#8217;s name he gave an excited squeak and toppledout of sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quiteright to think she wasn&#8217;t a teacher to cross. Strict andclever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in herfirst class.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerousmagic you will learn at Hogwarts,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Anyonemessing around in my class will leave and not come back. You havebeen warned.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They wereall very impressed and couldn&#8217;t wait to get started, but soonrealized they weren&#8217;t going to be changing the furniture intoanimals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes,they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into aneedle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had madeany difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the classhow it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a raresmile.
