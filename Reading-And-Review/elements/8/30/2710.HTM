<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Another Weasley, eh?&#8221; said Hagrid, glancing atRon&#8217;s freckles. &#8220;I spent half me life chasin&#8217; yertwin brothers away from the forest.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almostbroke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying themas they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested hishead on Harry&#8217;s knee and drooled all over his robes.</P>
