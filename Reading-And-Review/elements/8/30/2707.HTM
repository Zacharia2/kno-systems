<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape&#8217;s lips curled into a sneer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Tut, tut &#8212; fame clearly isn&#8217;teverything.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He ignored Hermione&#8217;s hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try again. Potter, where would you look if Itold you to find me a bezoar?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would gowithout her leaving her seat, but Harry didn&#8217;t have thefaintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy,Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thought you wouldn&#8217;t open a book before coming, eh,Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those coldeyes. He <I class=calibre9>had</I> looked through his books at theDursleys&#8217;, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in<I class=calibre9>One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi</I>?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape was still ignoring Hermione&#8217;s quivering hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood andwolfsbane?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward thedungeon ceiling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Harry quietly. &#8220;Ithink Hermione does, though, why don&#8217;t you tryher?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus&#8217;s eye, andSeamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he snapped at Hermione. &#8220;For yourinformation, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potionso powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar isa stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you frommost poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the sameplant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Whyaren&#8217;t you all copying that down?&#8221;
