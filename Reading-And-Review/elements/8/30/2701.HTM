<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Next to the tall kid with the red hair.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wearing the glasses?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Did you see his face?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Did you see his scar?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitorythe next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoeto get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridorsagain, staring. Harry wished they wouldn&#8217;t, because he wastrying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>There were a hundred and forty-twostaircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones;some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with avanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Thenthere were doors that wouldn&#8217;t open unless you askedpolitely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doorsthat weren&#8217;t really doors at all, but solid walls justpretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was,because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in theportraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure thecoats of armor could walk.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The ghosts didn&#8217;t help, either. It was always a nastyshock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you weretrying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point newGryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist wasworth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him whenyou were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on yourhead, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk,or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech,&#8220;GOT YOUR CONK!&#8221;
