<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker,Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of himon their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force theirway through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance tothe out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn&#8217;tbelieve they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into iton purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons whenthey were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-coloredcreature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch&#8217;s. Shepatrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, putjust one toe out of line, and she&#8217;d whisk off for Filch,who&#8217;d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew thesecret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhapsthe Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of theghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambitionof many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And then, once you had managed to find them, there were theclasses themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quicklyfound out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had to study the night skies through their telescopes everyWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars andthe movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out tothe greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpylittle witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how totake care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out whatthey were used for.
