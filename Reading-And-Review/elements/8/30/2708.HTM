<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over thenoise, Snape said, &#8220;And a point will be taken from GryffindorHouse for your cheek, Potter.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Things didn&#8217;t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potionslesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them tomixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in hislong black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snakefangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed tolike. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect wayMalfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smokeand a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managedto melt Seamus&#8217;s cauldron into a twisted blob, and theirpotion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes inpeople&#8217;s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standingon their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potionwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boilssprang up all over his arms and legs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Idiot boy!&#8221; snarled Snape, clearing the spilledpotion away with one wave of his wand. &#8220;I suppose you addedthe porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off thefire?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over hisnose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Take him up to the hospital wing,&#8221; Snape spat atSeamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working nextto Neville.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You &#8212; Potter &#8212; why didn&#8217;t you tell himnot to add the quills? Thought he&#8217;d make you look good if hegot it wrong, did you? That&#8217;s another point you&#8217;ve lostfor Gryffindor.&#8221;
