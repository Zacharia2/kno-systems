<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call,and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry&#8217;s name.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;Harry Potter. Ournew &#8212; <I class=calibre9>celebrity</I>.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behindtheir hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at theclass. His eyes were black like Hagrid&#8217;s, but they had noneof Hagrid&#8217;s warmth. They were cold and empty and made youthink of dark tunnels.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art ofpotion-making,&#8221; he began. He spoke in barely more than awhisper, but they caught every word &#8212; like ProfessorMcGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent withouteffort. &#8220;As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many ofyou will hardly believe this is magic. I don&#8217;t expect youwill really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldronwith its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creepthrough human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring thesenses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can teach you how to bottle fame,brew glory, even stopper death &#8212; if you aren&#8217;t as big abunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ronexchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on theedge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that shewasn&#8217;t a dunderhead.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter!&#8221; said Snape suddenly. &#8220;What would Iget if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion ofwormwood?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Powdered root of what to an infusion of what?</I> Harryglanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione&#8217;shand had shot into the air.
