<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this bynow, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning,when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hallduring breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners,and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hedwig hadn&#8217;t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimesflew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going offto sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning,however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugarbowl and dropped a note onto Harry&#8217;s plate. Harry tore itopen at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:</P>
<DIV class=block>

<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Dear Harry,</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>I know you get Friday afternoons off, so wouldyou like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I wantto hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back withHedwig.</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Hagrid</I></P></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Harry borrowed Ron&#8217;s quill, scribbled<I class=calibre9>Yes, please, see you later</I> on the back of the note, and sentHedwig off again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to,because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing thathad happened to him so far.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea thatProfessor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potionslesson, he knew he&#8217;d been wrong. Snape didn&#8217;t dislikeHarry &#8212; he <I class=calibre9>hated</I> him.</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>Potions lessons took place down in oneof the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, andwould have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animalsfloating in glass jars all around the walls.
