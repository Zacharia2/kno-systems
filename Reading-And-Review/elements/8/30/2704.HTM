<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The class everyone had really been looking forward to wasDefense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell&#8217;s lessons turnedout to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly ofgarlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he&#8217;dmet in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him oneof these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him byan African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesomezombie, but they weren&#8217;t sure they believed this story. Forone thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrellhad fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talkingabout the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smellhung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it wasstuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protectedwherever he went.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn&#8217;t milesbehind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle familiesand, like him, hadn&#8217;t had any idea that they were witches andwizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Rondidn&#8217;t have much of a head start.</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>Friday was an important day for Harryand Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the GreatHall for breakfast without getting lost once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What have we got today?&#8221; Harry asked Ron as hepoured sugar on his porridge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Double Potions with the Slytherins,&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;Snape&#8217;s Head of Slytherin House. They say he alwaysfavors them &#8212; we&#8217;ll be able to see if it&#8217;strue.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wish McGonagall favored us,&#8221; said Harry. ProfessorMcGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn&#8217;tstopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the daybefore.
