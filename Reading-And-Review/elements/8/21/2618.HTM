<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier &#8212; he was almost there &#8212; and then, quite suddenly, he wasn&#8217;t anywhere.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was nothing else for it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; Harry said to the plump woman.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hello, dear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;First time at Hogwarts? Ron&#8217;s new, too.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;The thing is &#8212; the thing is, I don&#8217;t know how to &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How to get onto the platform?&#8221; she said kindly, and Harry nodded.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not to worry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don&#8217;t stop and don&#8217;t be scared you&#8217;ll crash into it, that&#8217;s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you&#8217;re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; okay,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he&#8217;d be in trouble &#8212; leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run &#8212; the barrier was coming nearer and nearer &#8212; he wouldn&#8217;t be able to stop &#8212; the cart was out of control &#8212; he was a foot away &#8212; he closed his eyes ready for the crash &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It didn&#8217;t come&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he kept on running&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he opened his eyes.</P>
<P id=HP01CH06M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o&#8217;clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it.
