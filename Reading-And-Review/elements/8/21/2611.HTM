<P class=epubfirstparagraph>BOOM.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring atthe door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>B</SPAN>OOM. They knockedagain. Dudley jerked awake.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the cannon?&#8221; he said stupidly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skiddinginto the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands &#8212; now theyknew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought withthem.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I warn you&#8212; I&#8217;m armed!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a pause. Then &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>SMASH!</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off itshinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.</P>
<P id=HP01CH04M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>A giant of a man was standing in thedoorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggymane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out hiseyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.</P>
<P id=HP01CH04M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant squeezed his way into thehut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bentdown, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame.The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to lookat them all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t make us a cup o&#8217; tea, could yeh?It&#8217;s not been an easyjourney.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen withfear.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Budge up, yeh great lump,&#8221; said the stranger.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who wascrouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;An&#8217; here&#8217;s Harry!&#8221; said the giant.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw thatthe beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
