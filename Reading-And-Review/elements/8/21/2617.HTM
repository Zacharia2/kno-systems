<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, &#8220;There&#8217;s another one! &#8216;Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive &#8212;&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>With a <STRONG>strangled</STRONG> <STRONG>cry</STRONG>, Uncle Vernon <U><STRONG>leapt</STRONG> from his <STRONG>seat</STRONG></U> and <U><STRONG>ran</STRONG> down the hall</U>, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to <STRONG>wrestle</STRONG> Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had <STRONG>grabbed</STRONG> Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of <U>confused fighting</U>, in which everyone <U>got hit a lot</U> by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon <U>straightened up</U>, <STRONG>gasping</STRONG> for breath, with Harry&#8217;s letter <STRONG>clutched</STRONG> in his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to your cupboard &#8212; I mean, your bedroom,&#8221; he <STRONG>wheezed</STRONG> at Harry. &#8220;Dudley &#8212; go &#8212; just go.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry <U>walked round and round</U> his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn&#8217;t received his first letter. Surely that meant they&#8217;d try again? And this time he&#8217;d make sure they didn&#8217;t fail. He had a plan.</P>
<P class=break>The <STRONG>repaired</STRONG> alarm clock rang at six o&#8217;clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn&#8217;t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;AAAAARRRGH!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry leapt into the air; he&#8217;d <STRONG>trodden</STRONG> on something big and <STRONG>squashy</STRONG> on the <STRONG>doormat</STRONG> &#8212; something alive!
