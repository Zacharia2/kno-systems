<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My dear Friar, haven&#8217;t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he&#8217;s not really even a ghost &#8212; I say, what are you all doing here?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Nobody answered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;New students!&#8221; said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. &#8220;About to be Sorted, I suppose?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A few people nodded mutely.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!&#8221; said the Friar. &#8220;My old House, you know.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Move along now,&#8221; said a sharp voice. &#8220;The Sorting Ceremony&#8217;s about to start.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, form a line,&#8221; Professor McGonagall told the first years, &#8220;and follow me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, &#8220;It&#8217;s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.&#8221;
