<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his <STRONG>horror</STRONG> Harry realized that the big, <STRONG>squashy</STRONG> something had been his uncle&#8217;s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn&#8217;t do <STRONG>exactly</STRONG> what he&#8217;d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry<U> <STRONG>shuffled</STRONG> <STRONG>miserably</STRONG> off</U> into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon&#8217;s <STRONG>lap</STRONG>. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want &#8212;&#8221; he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t go to work that day. He stayed at home and <STRONG>nailed</STRONG> up the mail <STRONG>slot</STRONG>.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See,&#8221; he explained to Aunt Petunia through <U>a mouthful of nails</U>, &#8220;if they can&#8217;t <STRONG>deliver</STRONG> them they&#8217;ll just <U>give up</U>.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;ll work, Vernon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, these people&#8217;s minds work in <U>strange ways</U>, Petunia, they&#8217;re not like you and me,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.</P>
<P class=break>On Friday, <U>no less than twelve letters</U> arrived for Harry. As they couldn&#8217;t go through the <U>mail slot</U> they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After <STRONG>burning</STRONG> all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed <STRONG>&#8220;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&#8221;</STRONG> as he worked, and jumped at small noises.
