<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s been knocked out,&#8221; Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. &#8220;No &#8212; I don&#8217;t believe it &#8212; he&#8217;s gone back to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And so he had.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve met Malfoy before?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of his family,&#8221; said Ron darkly. &#8220;They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they&#8217;d been bewitched. My dad doesn&#8217;t believe it. He says Malfoy&#8217;s father didn&#8217;t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.&#8221; He turned to Hermione. &#8220;Can we help you with something?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;d better hurry up and put your robes on, I&#8217;ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we&#8217;re nearly there. You haven&#8217;t been fighting, have you? You&#8217;ll be in trouble before we even get there!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Scabbers has been fighting, not us,&#8221; said Ron, scowling at her. &#8220;Would you mind leaving while we change?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right &#8212; I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,&#8221; said Hermione in a sniffy voice. &#8220;And you&#8217;ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.</P>
<P id=HP01CH06M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron&#8217;s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A voice echoed through the train: &#8220;We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes&#8217; time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.&#8221;
