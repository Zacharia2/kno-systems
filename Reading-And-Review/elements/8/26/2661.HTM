<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Harry awkwardly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah yes,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Yes, yes. I thoughtI&#8217;d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;ta question. &#8220;You have your mother&#8217;s eyes. It seems onlyyesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and aquarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charmwork.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he wouldblink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand.Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent fortransfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it &#8212;it&#8217;s really the wand that chooses the wizard, ofcourse.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almostnose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those mistyeyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And that&#8217;s where&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry&#8217;sforehead with a long, white finger.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say I sold the wand that didit,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew.Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wronghands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, if I&#8217;d known what that wandwas going out into the world to do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He shook his head and then, to Harry&#8217;s relief, spottedHagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see youagain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy,wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was, sir, yes,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it inhalf when you got expelled?&#8221; said Mr. Ollivander, suddenlystern.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; yes, they did, yes,&#8221; said Hagrid,shuffling his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ve still got the pieces,though,&#8221; he added brightly.
