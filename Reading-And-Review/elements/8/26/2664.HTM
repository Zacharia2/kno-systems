<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shivered. He wasn&#8217;t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander toomuch. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivanderbowed them from his shop.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M04E class=break>The late afternoon sunhung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back downDiagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the LeakyCauldron, now empty. Harry didn&#8217;t speak at all as they walkeddown the road; he didn&#8217;t even notice how much people weregawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with alltheir funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cageon Harry&#8217;s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddingtonstation; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped himon the shoulder.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got time fer a bite to eat before yer trainleaves,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seatsto eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked sostrange, somehow.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,&#8221; saidHagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry wasn&#8217;t sure he could explain. He&#8217;d just hadthe best birthday of his life &#8212; and yet &#8212; he chewed hishamburger, trying to find the words.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Everyone thinks I&#8217;m special,&#8221; he said atlast. &#8220;All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, ProfessorQuirrell, Mr. Ollivander&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I don&#8217;tknow anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things?I&#8217;m famous and I can&#8217;t even remember what I&#8217;mfamous for. I don&#8217;t know what happened when Vol-, sorry&#8212; I mean, the night my parents died.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard andeyebrows he wore a very kind smile.
