<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do,like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley.He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping theticket inspector&#8217;s stand between platforms nine and ten.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and hecaught a few words of what they were saying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; packed with Muggles, of course &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talkingto four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing atrunk like Harry&#8217;s in front of him &#8212; and they had an<I class=calibre9>owl.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stoppedand so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, what&#8217;s the platform number?&#8221; said theboys&#8217; mother.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nine and three-quarters!&#8221; piped a small girl, alsored-headed, who was holding her hand. &#8220;Mum, can&#8217;t Igo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. Allright, Percy, you go first.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nineand ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it&#8212; but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier betweenthe two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in frontof him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boyhad vanished.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fred, you next,&#8221; the plump woman said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not Fred, I&#8217;m George,&#8221; said theboy. &#8220;Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?Can&#8217;t you <I class=calibre9>tell</I> I&#8217;m George?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry, George, dear.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Only joking, I am Fred,&#8221; said the boy, and off hewent. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have doneso, because a second later, he had gone &#8212; but how had he doneit?
