<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red.Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through thetrain&#8217;s open door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fred? George? Are you there?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Coming, Mum.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he couldwatch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they weresaying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ron, you&#8217;ve got something on your nose.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbedhim and began rubbing the end of his nose.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changedinto his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shinyred-and-gold badge on his chest with the letter <I class=calibre9>P</I> on it.</P>
