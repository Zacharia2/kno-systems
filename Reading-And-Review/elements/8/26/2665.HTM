Butyeh&#8217;ll have a great time at Hogwarts &#8212; I did &#8212;still do, &#8217;smatter of fact.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back tothe Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Firsto&#8217; September &#8212; King&#8217;s Cross &#8212; it&#8217;sall on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letterwith yer owl, she&#8217;ll know where to findme.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See yeh soon, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watchHagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressedhis nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid hadgone.</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>H</SPAN>arry&#8217;s last monthwith the Dursleys wasn&#8217;t fun. True, Dudley was now so scaredof Harry he wouldn&#8217;t stay in the same room, while AuntPetunia and Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t shut Harry in his cupboard,force him to do anything, or shout at him &#8212; in fact, theydidn&#8217;t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious,they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bitdepressing after a while.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He haddecided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in <I class=calibre9>A History ofMagic.</I> His school books were very interesting. He lay on hisbed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of theopen window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petuniadidn&#8217;t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig keptbringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harryticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to thewall, counting down to September the first.
