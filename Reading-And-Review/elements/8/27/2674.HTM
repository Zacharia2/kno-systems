<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat,which was asleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;His name&#8217;s Scabbers and he&#8217;s useless, hehardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made aprefect, but they couldn&#8217;t aff &#8212; I mean, I got Scabbersinstead.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron&#8217;s ears went pink. He seemed to think he&#8217;d saidtoo much, because he went back to staring out of the window.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t think there was anything wrong with not beingable to afford an owl. After all, he&#8217;d never had any money inhis life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having towear Dudley&#8217;s old clothes and never getting proper birthdaypresents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and until Hagrid told me, I didn&#8217;tknow anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;You said You-Know-Who&#8217;s name!&#8221;</I> saidRon, sounding both shocked and impressed. &#8220;I&#8217;d havethought you, of all people &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to be <I class=calibre9>brave</I> or anything,saying the name,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I just never knew youshouldn&#8217;t. See what I mean? I&#8217;ve got loads tolearn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I bet,&#8221; he added, voicing for thefirst time something that had been worrying him a lot lately,&#8220;I bet I&#8217;m the worst in the class.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be. There&#8217;s loads of people whocome from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>While they had been talking, the train had carried them out ofLondon. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flickpast.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside inthe corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door andsaid, &#8220;Anything off the cart, dears?&#8221;
