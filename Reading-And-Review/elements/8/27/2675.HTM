<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, who hadn&#8217;t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet,but Ron&#8217;s ears went pink again and he muttered thathe&#8217;d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into thecorridor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and nowthat he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready tobuy as many Mars Bars as he could carry &#8212; but the womandidn&#8217;t have Mars Bars. What she did have were BertieBott&#8217;s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble&#8217;s Best Blowing Gum,Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands,and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in hislife. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything andpaid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartmentand tipped it onto an empty seat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hungry, are you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Starving,&#8221; said Harry, taking a large bite out of apumpkin pasty.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want this, it&#8217;s all dry,&#8221;said Ron. &#8220;She hasn&#8217;t got much time,&#8221; he addedquickly, &#8220;you know, with five of us.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go on, have a pasty,&#8221; said Harry, who had never hadanything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. Itwas a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their waythrough all Harry&#8217;s pasties, cakes, and candies (thesandwiches lay forgotten).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are these?&#8221; Harry asked Ron, holding up a packof Chocolate Frogs. &#8220;They&#8217;re not
