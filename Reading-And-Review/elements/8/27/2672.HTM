<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right, keep your hair on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A whistle sounded.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; their mother said, and the three boysclambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her tokiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Ginny, we&#8217;ll send you loads ofowls.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;George!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Only joking, Mum.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The train began to move. Harry saw the boys&#8217; mother wavingand their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep upwith the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell backand waved.</P>
<P id=HP01CH06M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry watched the girl and her motherdisappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past thewindow. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn&#8217;t knowwhat he was going to &#8212; but it had to be better than what hewas leaving behind.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheadedboy came in.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Anyone sitting there?&#8221; he asked, pointing at theseat opposite Harry. &#8220;Everywhere else is full.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harryand then looked quickly out of the window, pretending hehadn&#8217;t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on hisnose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hey, Ron.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The twins were back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Listen, we&#8217;re going down the middle of the train&#8212; Lee Jordan&#8217;s got a giant tarantula downthere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right,&#8221; mumbled Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; said the other twin, &#8220;did weintroduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, ourbrother. See you later, then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bye,&#8221; said Harry and Ron. The twins slid thecompartment door shut behind them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you really Harry Potter?&#8221; Ron blurted out.
