<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When they shook their heads, he wailed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve losthim! He keeps getting away from me!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;ll turn up,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the boy miserably. &#8220;Well, if yousee him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He left.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s so bothered,&#8221; saidRon. &#8220;If I&#8217;d brought a toad I&#8217;d lose it as quickas I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can&#8217;ttalk.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The rat was still snoozing on Ron&#8217;s lap.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He might have died and you wouldn&#8217;t know thedifference,&#8221; said Ron in disgust. &#8220;I tried to turn himyellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spelldidn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ll show you,look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a verybattered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something whitewas glinting at the end.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Unicorn hair&#8217;s nearly poking out. Anyway&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid openagain. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl withhim. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Has anyone seen a toad? Neville&#8217;s lost one,&#8221;she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair,and rather large front teeth.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already told him we haven&#8217;t seenit,&#8221; said Ron, but the girl wasn&#8217;t listening, she waslooking at the wand in his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, are you doing magic? Let&#8217;s see it,then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; all right.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He cleared his throat.</P>

<P class=noindent>He waved his wand, but nothing happened.Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you sure that&#8217;s a real spell?&#8221; said thegirl. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not very good, is it? I&#8217;vetried a few simple spells just for practice and it&#8217;s allworked for me. Nobody in my family&#8217;s magic at all, it wasever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever sopleased, of course, I mean, it&#8217;s the very best school ofwitchcraft there is, I&#8217;ve heard &#8212; I&#8217;ve learnedall our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will beenough &#8212; I&#8217;m Hermione Granger, by the way, who areyou?&#8221;
