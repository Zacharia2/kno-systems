<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She said all this very fast.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned facethat he hadn&#8217;t learned all the course books by hearteither.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m Ron Weasley,&#8221; Ron muttered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry Potter,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you really?&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;I know allabout you, of course &#8212; I got a few extra books for backgroundreading, and you&#8217;re in <I class=calibre9>Modern Magical History</I> and<I class=calibre9>The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts</I> and <I class=calibre9>Great WizardingEvents of the Twentieth Century.&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; said Harry, feeling dazed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Goodness, didn&#8217;t you know, I&#8217;d have found outeverything I could if it was me,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;Doeither of you know what House you&#8217;ll be in? I&#8217;ve beenasking around, and I hope I&#8217;m in Gryffindor, it sounds by farthe best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I supposeRavenclaw wouldn&#8217;t be too bad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway,we&#8217;d better go and look for Neville&#8217;s toad. You two hadbetter change, you know, I expect we&#8217;ll be theresoon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Whatever House I&#8217;m in, I hope she&#8217;s not init,&#8221; said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk.&#8220;Stupid spell &#8212; George gave it to me, bet he knew itwas a dud.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What House are your brothers in?&#8221; asked Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Gryffindor,&#8221; said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settlingon him again. &#8220;Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don&#8217;tknow what they&#8217;ll say if I&#8217;m not. I don&#8217;t supposeRavenclaw <I class=calibre9>would</I> be too bad, but imagine if they put me inSlytherin.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who wasin?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Ron. He flopped back into his seat,looking depressed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know, I think the ends of Scabbers&#8217; whiskersare a bit lighter,&#8221; said Harry, trying to take Ron&#8217;smind off Houses. &#8220;So what do your oldest brothers do now thatthey&#8217;ve left, anyway?&#8221;
