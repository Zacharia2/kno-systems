<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he&#8217;d finishedschool.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Charlie&#8217;s in Romania studying dragons, andBill&#8217;s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,&#8221; saidRon. &#8220;Did you hear about Gringotts? It&#8217;s been all overthe <I class=calibre9>Daily Prophet,</I> but I don&#8217;t suppose you get thatwith the Muggles &#8212; someone tried to rob a high securityvault.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Really? What happened to them?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such big news. Theyhaven&#8217;t been caught. My dad says it must&#8217;ve been apowerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don&#8217;tthink they took anything, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s odd.&#8217;Course, everyone gets scared when something like thishappens in case You-Know-Who&#8217;s behind it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to geta prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. Hesupposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but ithad been a lot more comfortable saying &#8220;Voldemort&#8221;without worrying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s your Quidditch team?&#8221; Ron asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; I don&#8217;t know any,&#8221; Harryconfessed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What!&#8221; Ron looked dumbfounded. &#8220;Oh, you wait,it&#8217;s the best game in the world &#8212;&#8221; And he wasoff, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of theseven players, describing famous games he&#8217;d been to with hisbrothers and the broomstick he&#8217;d like to get if he had themoney. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of thegame when the compartment door slid open yet again, but itwasn&#8217;t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger thistime.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once:It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin&#8217;s robe shop. He waslooking at Harry with a lot more interest than he&#8217;d shownback in Diagon Alley.
