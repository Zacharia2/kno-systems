<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do they? What, they don&#8217;t move at all?&#8221; Ronsounded amazed. <I class=calibre9>&#8220;Weird!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on hiscard and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eatingthe frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, butHarry couldn&#8217;t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not onlyDumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion,Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away fromthe druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag ofBertie Bott&#8217;s Every Flavor Beans.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You want to be careful with those,&#8221; Ron warnedHarry. &#8220;When they say every flavor, they <I class=calibre9>mean</I> everyflavor &#8212; you know, you get all the ordinary ones likechocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can getspinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had abooger-flavored one once.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit intoa corner.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bleaaargh &#8212; see? Sprouts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry gottoast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee,sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funnygray one Ron wouldn&#8217;t touch, which turned out to bepepper.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder.The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers,and dark green hills.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a knock on the door of their compartment and theround-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine andthree-quarters came in. He looked tearful.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but have you seen a toad atall?&#8221;
