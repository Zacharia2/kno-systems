<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?&#8221; said one ofthe twins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s a <I class=calibre9>prefect</I>,&#8221; said theirmother fondly. &#8220;All right, dear, well, have a good term&#8212; send me an owl when you get there.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned tothe twins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, you two &#8212; this year, you behave yourselves. IfI get one more owl telling me you&#8217;ve &#8212; you&#8217;veblown up a toilet or &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Blown up a toilet? We&#8217;ve never blown up atoilet.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Great idea though, thanks, Mum.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>not funny.</I> And look afterRon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe withus.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Ron again. He was almost as tall asthe twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother hadrubbed it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hey, Mum, guess what? Guess who we just met on thetrain?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn&#8217;t see himlooking.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know that black-haired boy who was near us in thestation? Know who he is?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Harry Potter!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry heard the little girl&#8217;s voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, Mum, can I go on the train and see him, Mum, ohplease.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boyisn&#8217;t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred?How do you know?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Asked him. Saw his scar. It&#8217;s really there &#8212;like lightning.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Poor <I class=calibre9>dear</I> &#8212; no wonder he was alone, Iwondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto theplatform.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never mind that, do you think he remembers whatYou-Know-Who looks like?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Their mother suddenly became very stern.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don&#8217;t you dare.As though he needs reminding of that on his first day atschool.&#8221;
