<I class=calibre9>really</I> frogs,are they?&#8221; He was starting to feel that nothing wouldsurprise him. 
<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;But see what the card is.I&#8217;m missing Agrippa.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, of course, you wouldn&#8217;t know &#8212; ChocolateFrogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect &#8212; famouswitches and wizards. I&#8217;ve got about five hundred, but Ihaven&#8217;t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. Itshowed a man&#8217;s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long,crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache.Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So <I class=calibre9>this</I> is Dumbledore!&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;d never heard ofDumbledore!&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Can I have a frog? I might getAgrippa &#8212; thanks &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry turned over his card and read:</P>
<DIV class=top1>
<P class=center1>&nbsp;<SPAN class=calibre6>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</SPAN>&nbsp;</P>

<P class=noindent><SPAN class=calibre6>C</SPAN>onsidered by many the greatest wizard of moderntimes, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon&#8217;s blood, and his work onalchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Harry turned the card back over and saw, to hisastonishment, that Dumbledore&#8217;s face had disappeared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t expect him to hang around allday,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be back. No, I&#8217;vegot Morgana again and I&#8217;ve got about six ofher&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you want it? You can startcollecting.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron&#8217;s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waitingto be unwrapped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;But in, youknow, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.&#8221;
