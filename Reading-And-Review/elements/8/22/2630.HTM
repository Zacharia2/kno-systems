<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staffroom fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry&#8217;s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn&#8217;t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn&#8217;t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren&#8217;t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.
