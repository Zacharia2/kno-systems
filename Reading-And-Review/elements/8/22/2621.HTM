<P id=HP01CH08M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry&#8217;s name.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;Harry Potter. Our new &#8212; celebrity.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid&#8217;s, but they had none of Hagrid&#8217;s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,&#8221; he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word &#8212; like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. &#8220;As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don&#8217;t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death &#8212; if you aren&#8217;t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn&#8217;t a dunderhead.
