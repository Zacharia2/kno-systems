<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, music,&#8221; he said, wiping his eyes. &#8220;A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry&#8217;s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Peeves,&#8221; Percy whispered to the first years. &#8220;A poltergeist.&#8221; He raised his voice, &#8220;Peeves &#8212; show yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oooooooh!&#8221; he said, with an evil cackle. &#8220;Ickle Firsties! What fun!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go away, Peeves, or the Baron&#8217;ll hear about this, I mean it!&#8221; barked Percy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville&#8217;s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.
