<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell&#8217;s turban straight into Harry&#8217;s eyes &#8212; and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry&#8217;s forehead.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; Harry clapped a hand to his head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Percy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;N-nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher&#8217;s look &#8212; a feeling that he didn&#8217;t like Harry at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?&#8221; he asked Percy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he&#8217;s looking so nervous, that&#8217;s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn&#8217;t want to &#8212; everyone knows he&#8217;s after Quirrell&#8217;s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn&#8217;t look at him again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ahem &#8212; just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore&#8217;s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
