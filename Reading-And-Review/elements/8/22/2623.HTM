<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m half-and-half,&#8221; said Seamus. &#8220;Me dad&#8217;s a Muggle. Mum didn&#8217;t tell him she was a witch &#8217;til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The others laughed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What about you, Neville?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, my gran brought me up and she&#8217;s a witch,&#8221; said Neville, &#8220;but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me &#8212; he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned &#8212; but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced &#8212; all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here &#8212; they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>On Harry&#8217;s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (&#8220;I do hope they start right away, there&#8217;s so much to learn, I&#8217;m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it&#8217;s supposed to be very difficult &#8212;&#8221;; &#8220;You&#8217;ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing &#8212;&#8221;).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
