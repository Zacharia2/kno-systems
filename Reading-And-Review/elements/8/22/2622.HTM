<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore nodded glumly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>true</I>?&#8221;faltered Professor McGonagall. &#8220;After all he&#8217;sdone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all the people he&#8217;skilled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he couldn&#8217;t kill a little boy?It&#8217;s just astounding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of all the thingsto stop him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but how in the name of heaven didHarry survive?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We can only guess,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;We maynever know.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbedat her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniffas he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was avery odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, littleplanets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense toDumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,&#8220;Hagrid&#8217;s late. I suppose it was he who told youI&#8217;d be here, by the way?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall. &#8220;And Idon&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;re going to tell me <I class=calibre9>why</I>you&#8217;re here, of all places?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.They&#8217;re the only family he has left now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean &#8212; you <I class=calibre9>can&#8217;t</I> meanthe people who live <I class=calibre9>here</I>?&#8221; cried Professor McGonagall,jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. &#8220;Dumbledore&#8212; you can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been watching them all day. Youcouldn&#8217;t find two people who are less like us. Andthey&#8217;ve got this son &#8212; I saw him kicking his mother allthe way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come andlive here!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best place for him,&#8221; said Dumbledorefirmly. &#8220;His aunt and uncle will be able to explaineverything to him when he&#8217;s older. I&#8217;ve written them aletter.&#8221;
