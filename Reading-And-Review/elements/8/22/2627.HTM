<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You want to watch out for Peeves,&#8221; said Percy, as they set off again. &#8220;The Bloody Baron&#8217;s the only one who can control him, he won&#8217;t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Password?&#8221; she said.</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Caput Draconis,&#8221; said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it &#8212; Neville needed a leg up &#8212; and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase &#8212; they were obviously in one of the towers &#8212; they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Great food, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. &#8220;Get off, Scabbers! He&#8217;s chewing my sheets.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was going to ask Ron if he&#8217;d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell&#8217;s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn&#8217;t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully &#8212; and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it &#8212; then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold &#8212; there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
