<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had the best morning he&#8217;d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn&#8217;t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn&#8217;t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.</P>
<P id=HP01CH02M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon&#8217;s car and crushed it into a trash can &#8212; but at the moment it didn&#8217;t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make it move,&#8221; he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn&#8217;t budge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do it again,&#8221; Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is boring,&#8221; Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn&#8217;t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself &#8212; no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.
