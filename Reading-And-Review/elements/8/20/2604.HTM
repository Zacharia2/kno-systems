<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn&#8217;t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg&#8217;s cabbage-smelling living room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,&#8221; he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I had a dream about a motorcycle,&#8221; said Harry, remembering suddenly. &#8220;It was flying.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: &#8220;MOTORCYCLES DON&#8217;T FLY!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley and Piers sniggered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know they don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;It was only a dream.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But he wished he hadn&#8217;t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn&#8217;t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon &#8212; they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn&#8217;t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn&#8217;t blond.
