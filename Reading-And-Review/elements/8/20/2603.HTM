<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn&#8217;t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thirty-six,&#8221; he said, looking up at his mother and father. &#8220;That&#8217;s two less than last year.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Darling, you haven&#8217;t counted Auntie Marge&#8217;s present, see, it&#8217;s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right, thirty-seven then,&#8221; said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, &#8220;And we&#8217;ll buy you another two presents while we&#8217;re out today. How&#8217;s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, &#8220;So I&#8217;ll have thirty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thirty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thirty-nine, sweetums,&#8221; said Aunt Petunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh.&#8221; Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. &#8220;All right then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon chuckled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Little tyke wants his money&#8217;s worth, just like his father. &#8217;Atta boy, Dudley!&#8221; He ruffled Dudley&#8217;s hair.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bad news, Vernon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mrs. Figg&#8217;s broken her leg. She can&#8217;t take him.&#8221; She jerked her head in Harry&#8217;s direction.
