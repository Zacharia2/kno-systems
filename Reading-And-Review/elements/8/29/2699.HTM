<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chatteringcrowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase.Harry&#8217;s legs were like lead again, but only because he was sotired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised thatthe people in the portraits along the corridors whispered andpointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them throughdoorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. Theyclimbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harrywas just wondering how much farther they had to go when they cameto a sudden halt.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them,and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwingthemselves at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Peeves,&#8221; Percy whispered to the first years.&#8220;A poltergeist.&#8221; He raised his voice, &#8220;Peeves&#8212; show yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon,answered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and awide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutchingthe walking sticks.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oooooooh!&#8221; he said, with an evil cackle.&#8220;Ickle Firsties! What fun!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go away, Peeves, or the Baron&#8217;ll hear about this, Imean it!&#8221; barked Percy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walkingsticks on Neville&#8217;s head. They heard him zooming away,rattling coats of armor as he passed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You want to watch out for Peeves,&#8221; said Percy, asthey set off again. &#8220;The Bloody Baron&#8217;s the only onewho can control him, he won&#8217;t even listen to us prefects.Here we are.&#8221;
