<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Brocklehurst, Mandy&#8221; went to Ravenclaw too, but&#8220;Brown, Lavender&#8221; became the first new Gryffindor, andthe table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could seeRon&#8217;s twin brothers catcalling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bulstrode, Millicent&#8221; then became a Slytherin.Perhaps it was Harry&#8217;s imagination, after all he&#8217;dheard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like anunpleasant lot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered beingpicked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always beenlast to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no onewanted Dudley to think they liked him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Finch-Fletchley, Justin!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;HUFFLEPUFF!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once,but at others it took a little while to decide. &#8220;Finnigan,Seamus,&#8221; the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, saton the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared hima Gryffindor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Granger, Hermione!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly onher head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;GRYFFINDOR!&#8221; shouted the hat. Ron groaned.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always dowhen you&#8217;re very nervous. What if he wasn&#8217;t chosen atall? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages,until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said therehad obviously been a mistake and he&#8217;d better get back on thetrain?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, wascalled, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a longtime to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted,&#8220;GRYFFINDOR,&#8221; Neville ran off still wearing it, and hadto jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to &#8220;MacDougal,Morag.&#8221;
