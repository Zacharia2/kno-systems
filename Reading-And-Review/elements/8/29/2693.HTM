<P id=HP01CH07M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>He could see the High Table properlynow. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gavehim the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center ofthe High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harryrecognized him at once from the card he&#8217;d gotten out of theChocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore&#8217;s silver hair was theonly thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man fromthe Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purpleturban.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And now there were only four people left to be sorted.&#8220;Thomas, Dean,&#8221; a black boy even taller than Ron,joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. &#8220;Turpin, Lisa,&#8221;became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron&#8217;s turn. He was palegreen by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and asecond later the hat had shouted, &#8220;GRYFFINDOR!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into thechair next to him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well done, Ron, excellent,&#8221; said Percy Weasleypompously across Harry as &#8220;Zabini, Blaise,&#8221; was made aSlytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took theSorting Hat away.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only justrealized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed agesago.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at thestudents, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleasedhim more than to see them all there.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Welcome!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Welcome to a new year atHogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a fewwords. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
