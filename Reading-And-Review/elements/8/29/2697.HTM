<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked pastQuirrell&#8217;s turban straight into Harry&#8217;s eyes &#8212;and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry&#8217;sforehead.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; Harry clapped a hand to his head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Percy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;N-nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake offwas the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher&#8217;s look&#8212; a feeling that he didn&#8217;t like Harry at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that teacher talking to ProfessorQuirrell?&#8221; he asked Percy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonderhe&#8217;s looking so nervous, that&#8217;s Professor Snape. Heteaches Potions, but he doesn&#8217;t want to &#8212; everyoneknows he&#8217;s after Quirrell&#8217;s job. Knows an awful lotabout the Dark Arts, Snape.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn&#8217;t look athim again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledoregot to his feet again. The hall fell silent.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ahem &#8212; just a few more words now that we are allfed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to giveyou.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;First years should note that the forest on the grounds isforbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would dowell to remember that as well.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore&#8217;s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction ofthe Weasley twins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, toremind you all that no magic should be used between classes in thecorridors.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of theterm. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams shouldcontact Madam Hooch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And finally, I must tell you that this year, thethird-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds toeveryone who does not wish to die a very painful death.&#8221;
