<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chatwasn&#8217;t going at all the way he wanted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Like <I class=calibre9>this,</I>&#8221; he said irritably. He seized hisleft ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fellonto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviouslytried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased atthe stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped hishead back onto his neck, coughed, and said, &#8220;So &#8212; newGryffindors! I hope you&#8217;re going to help us win the HouseChampionship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long withoutwinning. Slytherins have got the Cup six years in a row! The BloodyBaron&#8217;s becoming almost unbearable &#8212; he&#8217;s theSlytherin ghost.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horribleghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, androbes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who,Harry was pleased to see, didn&#8217;t look too pleased with theseating arrangements.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did he get covered in blood?&#8221; asked Seamus withgreat interest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never asked,&#8221; said Nearly Headless Nickdelicately.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains ofthe food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean asbefore. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice creamin every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts,chocolate &#233;clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries,Jell-O, rice pudding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned totheir families.
