<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m half-and-half,&#8221; said Seamus. &#8220;Medad&#8217;s a Muggle. Mum didn&#8217;t tell him she was a witch&#8217;til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock forhim.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The others laughed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What about you, Neville?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, my gran brought me up and she&#8217;s awitch,&#8221; said Neville, &#8220;but the family thought I wasall-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch meoff my guard and force some magic out of me &#8212; he pushed meoff the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned &#8212; butnothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came roundfor dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by theankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and heaccidentally let go. But I bounced &#8212; all the way down thegarden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran wascrying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces whenI got in here &#8212; they thought I might not be magic enough tocome, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me mytoad.&#8221;</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up atthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. ProfessorQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher withgreasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
