<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fatwoman in a pink silk dress.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Password?&#8221; she said.</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Caput Draconis,&#8221; saidPercy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in thewall. They all scrambled through it &#8212; Neville needed a leg up&#8212; and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy,round room full of squashy armchairs.</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>Percy directed the girls through onedoor to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top ofa spiral staircase &#8212; they were obviously in one of the towers&#8212; they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung withdeep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been broughtup. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fellinto bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Great food, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Ron muttered to Harrythrough the hangings. &#8220;Get <I class=calibre9>off,</I> Scabbers! He&#8217;schewing my sheets.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was going to ask Ron if he&#8217;d had any of the treacletart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a verystrange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell&#8217;s turban,which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer toSlytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told theturban he didn&#8217;t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier andheavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully &#8212;and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it&#8212; then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape,whose laugh became high and cold &#8212; there was a burst of greenlight and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
