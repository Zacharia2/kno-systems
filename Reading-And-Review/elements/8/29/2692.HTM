<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got hiswish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,&#8220;SLYTHERIN!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, lookingpleased with himself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There weren&#8217;t many people left now.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Moon&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#8220;Nott&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#8220;Parkinson&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , then a pair of twingirls, &#8220;Patil&#8221; and&#8220;Patil&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , then &#8220;Perks,Sally-Anne&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , and then, at last&#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, Harry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out likelittle hissing fires all over the hall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Potter,</I> did she say?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>The</I> Harry Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyeswas the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Nextsecond he was looking at the black inside of the hat. Hewaited.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; said a small voice in his ear.&#8220;Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not abad mind either. There&#8217;s talent, oh my goodness, yes &#8212;and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that&#8217;sinteresting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So where shall I putyou?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, <I class=calibre9>NotSlytherin, not Slytherin.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not Slytherin, eh?&#8221; said the small voice.&#8220;Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it&#8217;s allhere in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way togreatness, no doubt about that &#8212; no? Well, if you&#8217;resure &#8212; better be GRYFFINDOR!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. Hetook off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. Hewas so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, hehardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy thePrefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasleytwins yelled, &#8220;We got Potter! We got Potter!&#8221; Harry satdown opposite the ghost in the ruff he&#8217;d seen earlier. Theghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feelinghe&#8217;d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
