<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harrydidn&#8217;t know whether to laugh or not.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is he &#8212; a bit mad?&#8221; he asked Percyuncertainly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mad?&#8221; said Percy airily. &#8220;He&#8217;s agenius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes.Potatoes, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him werenow piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked toeat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lambchops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes,fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, forsome strange reason, peppermint humbugs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he&#8217;dnever been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had alwaystaken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick.Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except thepeppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.</P>

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;veintroduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at yourservice. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know who you are!&#8221; said Ron suddenly. &#8220;Mybrothers told me about you &#8212; you&#8217;re Nearly HeadlessNick!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I would <I class=calibre9>prefer</I> you to call me Sir Nicholas deMimsy &#8212;&#8221; the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-hairedSeamus Finnigan interrupted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Nearly</I> Headless? How can you be
