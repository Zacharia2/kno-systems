<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s not serious?&#8221; he muttered to Percy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Must be,&#8221; said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore.&#8220;It&#8217;s odd, because he usually gives us a reason whywe&#8217;re not allowed to go somewhere &#8212; the forest&#8217;sfull of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he mighthave told us prefects, at least.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the schoolsong!&#8221; cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the otherteachers&#8217; smiles had become rather fixed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying toget a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it,which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike,into words.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Everyone pick their favorite tune,&#8221; saidDumbledore, &#8220;and off we go!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And the school bellowed:</P>

<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Our heads could do with filling</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>With some interesting stuff,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>For now they&#8217;re bare and full of air,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Dead flies and bits of fluff,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>So teach us things worth knowing,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Bring back what we&#8217;ve forgot,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Just do your best, we&#8217;ll do the rest,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>And learn until our brains all rot.&#8221;</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Everybody finished the song at different times.At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a veryslow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines withhis wand and when they had finished, he was one of those whoclapped loudest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, music,&#8221; he said, wiping his eyes. &#8220;Amagic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off youtrot!&#8221;
