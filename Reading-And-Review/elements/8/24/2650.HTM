<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He remembers!&#8221; cried Dedalus Diggle, looking aroundat everyone. &#8220;Did you hear that? He remembers me!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shook hands again and again &#8212; Doris Crockford keptcoming back for more.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One ofhis eyes was twitching.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Quirrell!&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Harry,Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers atHogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;P-P-Potter,&#8221; stammered Professor Quirrell, graspingHarry&#8217;s hand, &#8220;c-can&#8217;t t-tell you how p-pleased Iam to meet you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What sort of magic do you teach, ProfessorQuirrell?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,&#8221; mutteredProfessor Quirrell, as though he&#8217;d rather not think about it.&#8220;N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?&#8221; He laughednervously. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be g-getting all your equipment, Isuppose? I&#8217;ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,m-myself.&#8221; He looked terrified at the very thought.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But the others wouldn&#8217;t let Professor Quirrell keep Harryto himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all.At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Must get on &#8212; lots ter buy. Come on,Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Doris Crockford shook Harry&#8217;s hand one last time, andHagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walledcourtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a fewweeds.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid grinned at Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Told yeh, didn&#8217;t I? Told yeh you was famous. EvenProfessor Quirrell was tremblin&#8217; ter meet yeh &#8212; mindyou, he&#8217;s usually tremblin&#8217;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is he always that nervous?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine whilehe was studyin&#8217; outta books but then he took a year off terget some first-hand experience.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They say hemet vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bito&#8217; trouble with a hag &#8212; never been the same since.Scared of the students, scared of his own subject &#8212; now,where&#8217;s me umbrella?&#8221;
