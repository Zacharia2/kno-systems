<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read hisnewspaper, the <I class=calibre9>Daily Prophet.</I> Harry had learned from UncleVernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, butit was very difficult, he&#8217;d never had so many questions inhis life.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ministry o&#8217; Magic messin&#8217; things up asusual,&#8221; Hagrid muttered, turning the page.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s a Ministry of Magic?&#8221; Harry asked,before he could stop himself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8217;Course,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;They wantedDumbledore fer Minister, o&#8217; course, but he&#8217;d neverleave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if everthere was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,askin&#8217; fer advice.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what does a Ministry of Magic <I class=calibre9>do</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles thatthere&#8217;s still witches an&#8217; wizards up an&#8217; down thecountry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Why?</I> Blimey, Harry, everyone&#8217;d bewantin&#8217; magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we&#8217;rebest left alone.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stonesteps onto the street.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through thelittle town to the station. Harry couldn&#8217;t blame them. Notonly was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing atperfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly,&#8220;See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up,eh?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid,&#8221; said Harry, panting a bit as he ran tokeep up, &#8220;did you say there are <I class=calibre9>dragons</I> atGringotts?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, so they say,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Crikey,I&#8217;d like a dragon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;d
