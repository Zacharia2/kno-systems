<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vernon,&#8221; Aunt Petunia was saying in a quiveringvoice, &#8220;look at the address &#8212; how could they possiblyknow where he sleeps? You don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re watchingthe house?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Watching &#8212; spying &#8212; might be followingus,&#8221; muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tellthem we don&#8217;t want &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry could see Uncle Vernon&#8217;s shiny black shoes pacing upand down the kitchen.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;No, we&#8217;ll ignoreit. If they don&#8217;t get an answer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes,that&#8217;s best&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we won&#8217;t doanything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not having one in the house, Petunia!Didn&#8217;t we swear when we took him in we&#8217;d stamp out thatdangerous nonsense?&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>That evening when he got back from work, UncleVernon did something he&#8217;d never done before; he visited Harryin his cupboard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my letter?&#8221; said Harry, the momentUncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. &#8220;Who&#8217;swriting to me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,&#8221; saidUncle Vernon shortly. &#8220;I have burned it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was <I class=calibre9>not</I> a mistake,&#8221; said Harry angrily,&#8220;it had my cupboard on it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;SILENCE!&#8221; yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple ofspiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and thenforced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; yes, Harry &#8212; about this cupboard. Youraunt and I have been thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#8217;rereally getting a bit big for it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we think itmight be nice if you moved into Dudley&#8217;s secondbedroom.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask questions!&#8221; snapped his uncle.&#8220;Take this stuff upstairs, now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys&#8217; house had four bedrooms: one for UncleVernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually UncleVernon&#8217;s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and onewhere Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn&#8217;t fitinto his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs tomove everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He satdown on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in herewas broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small,working tank Dudley had once driven over the next doorneighbor&#8217;s dog; in the corner was Dudley&#8217;s first-evertelevision set, which he&#8217;d put his foot through when hisfavorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage,which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school fora real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bentbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books.They were the only things in the room that looked as thoughthey&#8217;d never been touched.
