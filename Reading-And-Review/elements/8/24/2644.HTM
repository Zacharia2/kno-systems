<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy smiled nastily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find &#8212; how about &#8212; up a tree?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give it here!&#8221; Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn&#8217;t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, &#8220;Come and get it, Potter!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry grabbed his broom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No!&#8221; shouted Hermione Granger. &#8220;Madam Hooch told us not to move &#8212; you&#8217;ll get us all into trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him &#8212; and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he&#8217;d found something he could do without being taught &#8212; this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give it here,&#8221; Harry called, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll knock you off that broom!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, yeah?&#8221; said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,&#8221; Harry called.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
