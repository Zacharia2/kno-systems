<P class=noindent>&#8220;Can we buy all this in London?&#8221;Harry wondered aloud.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If yeh know where to go,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=break>Harry had never been to London before. AlthoughHagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not usedto getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticketbarrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seatswere too small and the trains too slow.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how the Muggles manage withoutmagic,&#8221; he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator thatled up to a bustling road lined with shops.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harryhad to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops andmusic stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere thatlooked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just anordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really bepiles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there reallyshops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all besome huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harryhadn&#8217;t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, hemight have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagridhad told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn&#8217;t helptrusting him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is it,&#8221; said Hagrid, coming to a halt,&#8220;the Leaky Cauldron. It&#8217;s a famous place.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn&#8217;tpointed it out, Harry wouldn&#8217;t have noticed it was there. Thepeople hurrying by didn&#8217;t glance at it. Their eyes slid fromthe big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as ifthey couldn&#8217;t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harryhad the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.
