<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he hadmoved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn&#8217;treceived his first letter. Surely that meant they&#8217;d tryagain? And this time he&#8217;d make sure they didn&#8217;t fail.He had a plan.</P>
<P class=break>The repaired alarm clock rang at six o&#8217;clockthe next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently.He mustn&#8217;t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs withoutturning on any of the lights.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of PrivetDrive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammeredas he crept across the dark hall toward the front door &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;AAAAARRRGH!&#8221;</P>

Harry shuffledmiserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, themail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon&#8217;s lap. Harry couldsee three letters addressed in green ink.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want &#8212;&#8221; he began, but Uncle Vernon wastearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t go to work that day. He stayed at homeand nailed up the mail slot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See,&#8221; he explained to Aunt Petunia through amouthful of nails, &#8220;if they can&#8217;t
