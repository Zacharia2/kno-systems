<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Goblins?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; so yeh&#8217;d be mad ter try an&#8217; robit, I&#8217;ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry.Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh wantter keep safe &#8212;&#8217;cept maybe Hogwarts. As a mattero&#8217; fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore.Hogwarts business.&#8221; Hagrid drew himself up proudly. &#8220;Heusually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin&#8217; you&#8212; gettin&#8217; things from Gringotts &#8212; knows he cantrust me, see.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got everythin&#8217;? Come on, then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clearnow and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon hadhired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after thestorm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did you get here?&#8221; Harry asked, looking aroundfor another boat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Flew,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Flew?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; but we&#8217;ll go back in this. Nots&#8217;pposed ter use magic now I&#8217;ve got yeh.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid,trying to imagine him flying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Seems a shame ter row, though,&#8221; said Hagrid, givingHarry another of his sideways looks. &#8220;If I was ter &#8212; er&#8212; speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin&#8217;it at Hogwarts?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Harry, eager to see moremagic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twiceon the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?&#8221;Harry asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Spells &#8212; enchantments,&#8221; said Hagrid,unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. &#8220;They say there&#8217;sdragons guardin&#8217; the high-security vaults. And then yeh gottafind yer way &#8212; Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London,see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh&#8217;d die of hungertryin&#8217; ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer handson summat.&#8221;
