<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Sprayfrom the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fiercewind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldyblankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on themoth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bednext door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor hecould and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.Harry couldn&#8217;t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying toget comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley&#8217;ssnores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started nearmidnight. The lighted dial of Dudley&#8217;s watch, which wasdangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harryhe&#8217;d be eleven in ten minutes&#8217; time. He lay and watchedhis birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would rememberat all, wondering where the letter writer was now.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. Hehoped the roof wasn&#8217;t going to fall in, although he might bewarmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in PrivetDrive would be so full of letters when they got back thathe&#8217;d be able to steal one somehow.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rocklike that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunchingnoise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>One minute to go and he&#8217;d be eleven. Thirtyseconds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twenty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.ten&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nine &#8212; maybe he&#8217;d wake Dudleyup, just to annoy him &#8212; three&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
