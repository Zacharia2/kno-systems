<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stand back,&#8221; said Griphook importantly. He strokedthe door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply meltedaway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they&#8217;dbe sucked through the door and trapped in there,&#8221; saidGriphook.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How often do you check to see if anyone&#8217;sinside?&#8221; Harry asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;About once every ten years,&#8221; said Griphook with arather nasty grin.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this topsecurity vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly,expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least &#8212; but atfirst he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby littlepackage wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid pickedit up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know whatit was, but knew better than to ask.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don&#8217;t talkto me on the way back, it&#8217;s best if I keep me mouthshut,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M03S class=break>One wild cart ride laterthey stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harrydidn&#8217;t know where to run first now that he had a bag full ofmoney. He didn&#8217;t have to know how many Galleons there were toa pound to know that he was holding more money than he&#8217;d hadin his whole life &#8212; more money than even Dudley had everhad.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Might as well get yer uniform,&#8221; said Hagrid,nodding toward Madam Malkin&#8217;s Robes for All Occasions.&#8220;Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer apick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringottscarts.&#8221; He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered MadamMalkin&#8217;s shop alone, feeling nervous.
