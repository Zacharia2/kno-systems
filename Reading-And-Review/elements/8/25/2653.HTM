<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; said Hagrid at last, holding up a tinygolden key.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The goblin looked at it closely.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That seems to be in order.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve also got a letter here fromProfessor Dumbledore,&#8221; said Hagrid importantly, throwing outhis chest. &#8220;It&#8217;s about the You-Know-What in vault sevenhundred and thirteen.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The goblin read the letter carefully.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, handing it back to Hagrid,&#8220;I will have someone take you down to both vaults.Griphook!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all thedog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followedGriphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred andthirteen?&#8221; Harry asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell yeh that,&#8221; said Hagridmysteriously. &#8220;Very secret. Hogwarts business.Dumbledore&#8217;s trusted me. More&#8217;n my job&#8217;s worthter tell yeh that.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expectedmore marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passagewaylit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there werelittle railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a smallcart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in&#8212; Hagrid with some difficulty &#8212; and were off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork,right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed toknow its own way, because Griphook wasn&#8217;t steering.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, buthe kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire atthe end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon,but too late &#8212; they plunged even deeper, passing anunderground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew fromthe ceiling and floor.
