<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I never know,&#8221; Harry called to Hagrid over thenoise of the cart, &#8220;what&#8217;s the difference between astalagmite and a stalactite?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stalagmite&#8217;s got an &#8216;m&#8217; in it,&#8221;said Hagrid. &#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217; ask me questions just now,I think I&#8217;m gonna be sick.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last besidea small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to leanagainst the wall to stop his knees from trembling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowingout, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of goldcoins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All yours,&#8221; smiled Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All Harry&#8217;s &#8212; it was incredible. The Dursleyscouldn&#8217;t have known about this or they&#8217;d have had itfrom him faster than blinking. How often had they complained howmuch Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been asmall fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The gold ones are Galleons,&#8221; he explained.&#8220;Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knutsto a Sickle, it&#8217;s easy enough. Right, that should be enoughfer a couple o&#8217; terms, we&#8217;ll keep the rest safe foryeh.&#8221; He turned to Griphook. &#8220;Vault seven hundred andthirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;One speed only,&#8221; said Griphook.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The airbecame colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. Theywent rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over theside to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagridgroaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
