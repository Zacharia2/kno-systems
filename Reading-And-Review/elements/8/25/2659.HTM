<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217; that&#8217;s not a good idea,but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in veryspecial circumstances,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;An&#8217; anyway,yeh couldn&#8217; work any of them curses yet, yeh&#8217;ll need alot more study before yeh get ter that level.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid wouldn&#8217;t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron,either (&#8220;It says pewter on yer list&#8221;), but they got anice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and acollapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary,which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, amixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuffstood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powderslined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarledclaws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind thecounter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry,Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleonseach and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts ascoop).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry&#8217;s listagain.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just yer wand left &#8212; oh yeah, an&#8217; I stillhaven&#8217;t got yeh a birthday present.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt himself go red.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to &#8212;&#8221;</P>

Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago,yeh&#8217;d be laughed at &#8212; an&#8217; I don&#8217; like cats,they make me sneeze. I&#8217;ll get yer an owl. All the kids wantowls, they&#8217;re dead useful, carry yer mail an&#8217;everythin&#8217;.&#8221;
