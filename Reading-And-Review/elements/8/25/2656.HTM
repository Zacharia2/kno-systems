<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all inmauve.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hogwarts, dear?&#8221; she said, when Harry started tospeak. &#8220;Got the lot here &#8212; another young man beingfitted up just now, in fact.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face wasstanding on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his longblack robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him,slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the rightlength.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;Hogwarts,too?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My father&#8217;s next door buying my books andMother&#8217;s up the street looking at wands,&#8221; said the boy.He had a bored, drawling voice. &#8220;Then I&#8217;m going to dragthem off to look at racing brooms. I don&#8217;t see why firstyears can&#8217;t have their own. I think I&#8217;ll bully Fatherinto getting me one and I&#8217;ll smuggle it insomehow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Have <I class=calibre9>you</I> got your own broom?&#8221; the boy wenton.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Play Quidditch at all?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; Harry said again, wondering what on earthQuidditch could be.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>I</I> do &#8212; Father says it&#8217;s a crime ifI&#8217;m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree.Know what House you&#8217;ll be in yet?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harry, feeling more stupid by theminute.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they,but I know I&#8217;ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been&#8212; imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I&#8217;d leave,wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mmm,&#8221; said Harry, wishing he could say something abit more interesting.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I say, look at that man!&#8221; said the boy suddenly,nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there,grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show hecouldn&#8217;t come in.
