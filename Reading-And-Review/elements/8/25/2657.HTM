<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s Hagrid,&#8221; said Harry, pleased to knowsomething the boy didn&#8217;t. &#8220;He works atHogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of him.He&#8217;s a sort of servant, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s the gamekeeper,&#8221; said Harry. He wasliking the boy less and less every second.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, exactly. I heard he&#8217;s a sort of <I class=calibre9>savage</I>&#8212; lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and thenhe gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to hisbed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s brilliant,&#8221; said Harrycoldly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Do</I> you?&#8221; said the boy, with a slight sneer.&#8220;Why is he with you? Where are your parents?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;re dead,&#8221; said Harry shortly. Hedidn&#8217;t feel much like going into the matter with thisboy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, sorry,&#8221; said the other, not sounding sorry atall. &#8220;But they were <I class=calibre9>our</I> kind, weren&#8217;tthey?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They were a witch and wizard, if that&#8217;s what youmean.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think they should let the other sortin, do you? They&#8217;re just not the same, they&#8217;ve neverbeen brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never evenheard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think theyshould keep it in the old wizarding families. What&#8217;s yoursurname, anyway?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,&#8220;That&#8217;s you done, my dear,&#8221; and Harry, not sorryfor an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from thefootstool.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,&#8221;said the drawling boy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had boughthim (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchmentand quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of inkthat changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, hesaid, &#8220;Hagrid, what&#8217;s Quidditch?&#8221;
