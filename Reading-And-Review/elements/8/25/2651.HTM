<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Vampires? Hags? Harry&#8217;s head was swimming. Hagrid,meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twoacross&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Right, standback, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He tapped the wall three times with the point of hisumbrella.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>The brick he had touched quivered&#8212; it wriggled &#8212; in the middle, a small hole appeared&#8212; it grew wider and wider &#8212; a second later they werefacing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto acobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; said Hagrid, &#8220;to DiagonAlley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He grinned at Harry&#8217;s amazement. They stepped through thearchway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archwayshrink instantly back into solid wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside thenearest shop. Cauldrons &#8212; All Sizes &#8212; Copper, Brass,Pewter, Silver &#8212; Self-Stirring &#8212; Collapsible, said asign hanging over them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;ll be needin&#8217; one,&#8221; saidHagrid, &#8220;but we gotta get yer money first.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head inevery direction as they walked up the street, trying to look ateverything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the peopledoing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary wasshaking her head as they passed, saying, &#8220;Dragon liver,sixteen Sickles an ounce, they&#8217;remad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign sayingEeylops Owl Emporium &#8212; Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, andSnowy. Several boys of about Harry&#8217;s age had their nosespressed against a window with broomsticks in it.&#8220;Look,&#8221; Harry heard one of them say, &#8220;the newNimbus Two Thousand &#8212; fastest ever &#8212;&#8221; There wereshops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silverinstruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked withbarrels of bat spleens and eels&#8217; eyes, tottering piles ofspell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globesof the moon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
