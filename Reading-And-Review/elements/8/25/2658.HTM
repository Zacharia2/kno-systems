<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin&#8217; how little yehknow &#8212; not knowin&#8217; about Quidditch!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me feel worse,&#8221; said Harry. Hetold Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin&#8217;s.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; and he said people from Muggle familiesshouldn&#8217;t even be allowed in &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yer not <I class=calibre9>from</I> a Muggle family. If he&#8217;d knownwho yeh <I class=calibre9>were</I> &#8212; he&#8217;s grown up knowin&#8217; yername if his parents are wizardin&#8217; folk. You saw what everyonein the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what doeshe know about it, some o&#8217; the best I ever saw were the onlyones with magic in &#8217;em in a long line o&#8217; Muggles&#8212; look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So what <I class=calibre9>is</I> Quidditch?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s our sport. Wizard sport. It&#8217;s like&#8212; like soccer in the Muggle world &#8212; everyone followsQuidditch &#8212; played up in the air on broomsticks andthere&#8217;s four balls &#8212; sorta hard ter explain therules.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;School Houses. There&#8217;s four. Everyone saysHufflepuff are a lot o&#8217; duffers, but &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I bet I&#8217;m in Hufflepuff,&#8221; said Harrygloomily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,&#8221; said Hagriddarkly. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a single witch or wizard who wentbad who wasn&#8217;t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vol-, sorry &#8212; You-Know-Who was atHogwarts?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Years an&#8217; years ago,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They bought Harry&#8217;s school books in a shop called Flourishand Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with booksas large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size ofpostage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbolsand a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who neverread anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some ofthese. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from
