<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which hadbeen dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes.Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl,fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn&#8217;t stopstammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217; mention it,&#8221;said Hagrid gruffly. &#8220;Don&#8217; expect you&#8217;ve had alotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now&#8212; only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have thebest wand.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A magic wand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this was what Harry had beenreally looking forward to.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters overthe door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382<SPAN class=sc>B.C.</SPAN> A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion inthe dusty window.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M04S class=epubfirstparagraph>A tinkling bell rang somewhere in thedepths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place,empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on towait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strictlibrary; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurredto him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piledneatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of hisneck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tinglewith some secret magic.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; said a soft voice. Harry jumped.Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunchingnoise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shininglike moons through the gloom of the shop.
