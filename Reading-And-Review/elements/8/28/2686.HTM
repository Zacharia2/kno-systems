<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around thehuge, oak front door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?&#8221;</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>T</SPAN>he door swung open atonce. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stoodthere. She had a very stern face and Harry&#8217;s first thoughtwas that this was not someone to cross.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The firs&#8217; years, Professor McGonagall,&#8221; saidHagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>She pulled the door wide. The entrancehall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys&#8217;house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like theones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and amagnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upperfloors.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stonefloor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from adoorway to the right &#8212; the rest of the school must already behere &#8212; but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into asmall, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rathercloser together than they would usually have done, peering aboutnervously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Welcome to Hogwarts,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall.&#8220;The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before youtake your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into yourHouses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while youare here, your House will be something like your family withinHogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleepin your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House commonroom.
