<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in theair &#8212; several people behind him screamed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What the &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts hadjust streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightlytransparent, they glided across the room talking to one another andhardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. Whatlooked like a fat little monk was saying: &#8220;Forgive andforget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My dear Friar, haven&#8217;t we given Peeves all thechances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know,he&#8217;s not really even a ghost &#8212; I say, what are you alldoing here?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the firstyears.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Nobody answered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;New students!&#8221; said the Fat Friar, smiling aroundat them. &#8220;About to be Sorted, I suppose?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A few people nodded mutely.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!&#8221; said the Friar.&#8220;My old House, you know.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Move along now,&#8221; said a sharp voice. &#8220;TheSorting Ceremony&#8217;s about to start.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghostsfloated away through the opposite wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, form a line,&#8221; Professor McGonagall told thefirst years, &#8220;and follow me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry gotinto line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, andthey walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through apair of double doors into the Great Hall.</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had never even imagined such astrange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousandsof candles that were floating in midair over four long tables,where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laidwith glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hallwas another long table where the teachers were sitting. ProfessorMcGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a haltin a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns inthe flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among thestudents, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all thestaring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceilingdotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, &#8220;It&#8217;sbewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in
