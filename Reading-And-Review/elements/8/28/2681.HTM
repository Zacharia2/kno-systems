<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re sayingall down the train that Harry Potter&#8217;s in this compartment.So it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry. He was looking at the other boys.Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing oneither side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,&#8221; said thepale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. &#8220;Andmy name&#8217;s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.Draco Malfoy looked at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Think my name&#8217;s funny, do you? No need to ask whoyou are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair,freckles, and more children than they can afford.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He turned back to Harry. &#8220;You&#8217;ll soon find out somewizarding families are much better than others, Potter. Youdon&#8217;t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I canhelp you there.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He held out his hand to shake Harry&#8217;s, but Harrydidn&#8217;t take it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,thanks,&#8221; he said coolly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Draco Malfoy didn&#8217;t go red, but a pink tinge appeared inhis pale cheeks.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d be careful if I were you, Potter,&#8221; hesaid slowly. &#8220;Unless you&#8217;re a bit politer you&#8217;llgo the same way as your parents. They didn&#8217;t know what wasgood for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like theWeasleys and that Hagrid, and it&#8217;ll rub off onyou.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Both Harry and Ron stood up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Say that again,&#8221; Ron said, his face as red as hishair.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to fight us, are you?&#8221;Malfoy sneered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Unless you get out now,&#8221; said Harry, more bravelythan he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than himor Ron.
