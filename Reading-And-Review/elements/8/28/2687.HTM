<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff,Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history andeach has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are atHogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while anyrule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, theHouse with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor.I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomesyours.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes infront of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smartenyourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville&#8217;s cloak, whichwas fastened under his left ear, and on Ron&#8217;s smudged nose.Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I shall return when we are ready for you,&#8221; saidProfessor McGonagall. &#8220;Please wait quietly.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How exactly do they sort us into Houses?&#8221; he askedRon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, butI think he was joking.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front ofthe whole school? But he didn&#8217;t know any magic yet &#8212;what on earth would he have to do? He hadn&#8217;t expectedsomething like this the moment they arrived. He looked aroundanxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No onewas talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering veryfast about all the spells she&#8217;d learned and wondering whichone she&#8217;d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her.He&#8217;d never been more nervous, never, not even when he&#8217;dhad to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying thathe&#8217;d somehow turned his teacher&#8217;s wig blue. He kept hiseyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall wouldcome back and lead him to his doom.
