<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t feel like leaving, do we, boys?We&#8217;ve eaten all our food and you still seem to havesome.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron &#8212; Ronleapt forward, but before he&#8217;d so much as touched Goyle,Goyle let out a horrible yell.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teethsunk deep into Goyle&#8217;s knuckle &#8212; Crabbe and Malfoybacked away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, andwhen Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three ofthem disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more ratslurking among the sweets, or perhaps they&#8217;d heard footsteps,because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What <I class=calibre9>has</I> been going on?&#8221; she said, lookingat the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by histail.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s been knocked out,&#8221; Ron said toHarry. He looked closer at Scabbers. &#8220;No &#8212; Idon&#8217;t believe it &#8212; he&#8217;s gone back tosleep.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And so he had.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve met Malfoy before?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of his family,&#8221; said Ron darkly.&#8220;They were some of the first to come back to our side afterYou-Know-Who disappeared. Said they&#8217;d been bewitched. My daddoesn&#8217;t believe it. He says Malfoy&#8217;s fatherdidn&#8217;t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.&#8221; Heturned to Hermione. &#8220;Can we help you withsomething?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;d better hurry up and put your robes on,I&#8217;ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and hesays we&#8217;re nearly there. You haven&#8217;t been fighting,have you? You&#8217;ll be in trouble before we even getthere!&#8221;
