<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying along, thin package and didn&#8217;t answer Aunt Petunia when sheasked what he&#8217;d bought.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Found the perfect place!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come on!Everyone out!&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>It was very cold outside the car.Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way outat sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable littleshack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was notelevision in there.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Storm forecast for tonight!&#8221; said Uncle Vernongleefully, clapping his hands together. &#8220;And thisgentleman&#8217;s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with arather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-graywater below them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already got us some rations,&#8221; said UncleVernon, &#8220;so all aboard!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept downtheir necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After whatseemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon,slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>The inside was horrible; it smelledstrongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in thewooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were onlytwo rooms.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon&#8217;s rations turned out to be a bag of chipseach and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chipbags just smoked and shriveled up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Could do with some of those letters now, eh?&#8221; hesaid cheerfully.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood achance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harryprivately agreed, though the thought didn&#8217;t cheer him up atall.
