<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh&#8217;ll get yer firs&#8217; sight o&#8217; Hogwartsin a sec,&#8221; Hagrid called over his shoulder, &#8220;jus&#8217;round this bend here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a loud &#8220;Oooooh!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a greatblack lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, itswindows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with manyturrets and towers.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No more&#8217;n four to a boat!&#8221; Hagrid called,pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by theshore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville andHermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Everyone in?&#8221; shouted Hagrid, who had a boat tohimself. &#8220;Right then &#8212; FORWARD!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, glidingacross the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent,staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them asthey sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Heads down!&#8221; yelled Hagrid as the first boatsreached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boatscarried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening inthe cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemedto be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached akind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks andpebbles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oy, you there! Is this your toad?&#8221; said Hagrid, whowas checking the boats as people climbed out of them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Trevor!&#8221; cried Neville blissfully, holding out hishands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock afterHagrid&#8217;s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grassright in the shadow of the castle.
