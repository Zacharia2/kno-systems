<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Scabbers has been fighting, not us,&#8221; said Ron,scowling at her. &#8220;Would you mind leaving while wechange?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right &#8212; I only came in here because peopleoutside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down thecorridors,&#8221; said Hermione in a sniffy voice. &#8220;Andyou&#8217;ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did youknow?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window.It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under adeep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.</P>
<P id=HP01CH06M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>He and Ron took off their jackets andpulled on their long black robes. Ron&#8217;s were a bit short forhim, you could see his sneakers underneath them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A voice echoed through the train: &#8220;We will be reachingHogwarts in five minutes&#8217; time. Please leave your luggage onthe train, it will be taken to the school separately.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw,looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with thelast of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushedtheir way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing overthe heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice:&#8220;Firs&#8217; years! Firs&#8217; years over here! All rightthere, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid&#8217;s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;C&#8217;mon, follow me &#8212; any more firs&#8217;years? Mind yer step, now! Firs&#8217; years follow me!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed tobe a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them thatHarry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much.Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once ortwice.
