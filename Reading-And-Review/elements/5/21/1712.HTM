<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come back, boy!&#8221; she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle &#8212; twelve feet &#8212; twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>WHAM &#8212; a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Broken wrist,&#8221; Harry heard her mutter. &#8220;Come on, boy &#8212; it&#8217;s all right, up you get.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She turned to the rest of the class.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you&#8217;ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say &#8216;Quidditch.&#8217; Come on, dear.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Did you see his face, the great lump?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The other Slytherins joined in.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up, Malfoy,&#8221; snapped Parvati Patil.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?&#8221; said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. &#8220;Never thought you&#8217;d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. &#8220;It&#8217;s that stupid thing Longbottom&#8217;s gran sent him.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give that here, Malfoy,&#8221; said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.
