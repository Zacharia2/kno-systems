<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid!&#8221; said Harry loudly. &#8220;There&#8217;s anowl &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Pay him,&#8221; Hagrid grunted into the sofa.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He wants payin&#8217; fer deliverin&#8217; the paper.Look in the pockets.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid&#8217;s coat seemed to be made of nothing <I class=calibre9>but</I>pockets &#8212; bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string,peppermint humbugs, teabags&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. finally, Harrypulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give him five Knuts,&#8221; said Hagrid sleepily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Knuts?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The little bronze ones.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held outhis leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouchtied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up terLondon an&#8217; buy all yer stuff fer school.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. Hehad just thought of something that made him feel as though thehappy balloon inside him had got a puncture.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Um &#8212; Hagrid?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mm?&#8221; said Hagrid, who was pulling on his hugeboots.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; said Hagrid,standing up and scratching his head. &#8220;D&#8217;yeh think yerparents didn&#8217;t leave yeh anything?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But if their house was destroyed &#8212;&#8221;</P>
