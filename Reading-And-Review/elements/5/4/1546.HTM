<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Gringotts,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had reached a snowy white building that towered over theother little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors,wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was &#8212;</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s agoblin,&#8221; said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the whitestone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter thanHarry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harrynoticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walkedinside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver thistime, with words engraved upon them:</P>

<P class=noindent>&#8220;Like I said, yeh&#8217;d be mad ter tryan&#8217; rob it,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>A pair of goblins bowed them throughthe silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About ahundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a longcounter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brassscales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There weretoo many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblinswere showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made forthe counter.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Morning,&#8221; said Hagrid toa free goblin. &#8220;We&#8217;ve come ter take some money outtaMr. Harry Potter&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You have his key, sir?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got it here somewhere,&#8221; said Hagrid, and he startedemptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful ofmoldy dog biscuits over the goblin&#8217;s book of numbers. Thegoblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their rightweighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.
