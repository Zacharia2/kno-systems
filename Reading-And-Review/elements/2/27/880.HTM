<I class=calibre9>Platform Nine and Three-Quarters</I> on it. He had doneit. 
<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chatteringcrowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between theirlegs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way overthe babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.</P>
<P id=HP01CH06M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>The first few carriages were alreadypacked with students, some hanging out of the window to talk totheir families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart offdown the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed around-faced boy who was saying, &#8220;Gran, I&#8217;ve lost mytoad again.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, <I class=calibre9>Neville,</I>&#8221; he heard the old womansigh.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give us a look, Lee, go on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the peoplearound him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out along, hairy leg.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an emptycompartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside firstand then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the traindoor. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise oneend and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Want a hand?&#8221; It was one of the red-haired twinshe&#8217;d followed through the barrier.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, please,&#8221; Harry panted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oy, Fred! C&#8217;mere and help!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>With the twins&#8217; help, Harry&#8217;s trunk was at lasttucked away in a corner of the compartment.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out ofhis eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said one of the twins suddenly,pointing at Harry&#8217;s lightning scar.
