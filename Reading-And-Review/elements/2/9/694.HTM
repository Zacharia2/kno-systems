<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Las&#8217; time I saw you, you was only a baby,&#8221;said the giant. &#8220;Yeh look a lot like yer dad, butyeh&#8217;ve got yer mum&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I demand that you leave at once, sir!&#8221; he said.&#8220;You are breaking and entering!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,&#8221; said thegiant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out ofUncle Vernon&#8217;s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if ithad been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of theroom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse beingtrodden on.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Anyway &#8212; Harry,&#8221; said the giant, turning hisback on the Dursleys, &#8220;a very happy birthday to yeh. Gotsummat fer yeh here &#8212; I mighta sat on it at some point, butit&#8217;ll taste all right.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightlysquashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was alarge, sticky chocolate cake with <I class=calibre9>Happy Birthday Harry</I>written on it in green icing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but thewords got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said insteadwas, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant chuckled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;True, I haven&#8217;t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid,Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry&#8217;s wholearm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What about that tea then, eh?&#8221; he said, rubbing hishands together. &#8220;I&#8217;d not say no ter summat stronger ifyeh&#8217;ve got it, mind.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags init and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; theycouldn&#8217;t see what he was doing but when he drew back a secondlater, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hutwith flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him asthough he&#8217;d sunk into a hot bath.
