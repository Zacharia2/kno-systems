<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry hadn&#8217;t had a single letter since Hagrid&#8217;s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy&#8217;s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Remembrall!&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Gran knows I forget things &#8212; this tells you if there&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red &#8212; oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#8217;ve forgotten something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville was trying to remember what he&#8217;d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy&#8217;s got my Remembrall, Professor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just looking,&#8221; he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.</P>
<P class=break>At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.
