<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He&#8217;d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until hepassed a group of them next to the baker&#8217;s. He eyed themangrily as he passed. He didn&#8217;t know why, but they made himuneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and hecouldn&#8217;t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way backpast them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught afew words of what they were saying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Potters, that&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s what Iheard &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; yes, their son, Harry &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back atthe whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, butthought better of it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office,snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone,and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed hismind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache,thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, he was being stupid. Potterwasn&#8217;t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots ofpeople called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think ofit, he wasn&#8217;t even sure his nephew <I class=calibre9>was</I> called Harry.He&#8217;d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. OrHarold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always gotso upset at any mention of her sister. He didn&#8217;t blame her&#8212; if <I class=calibre9>he&#8217;d</I> had a sister likethat&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but all the same, those people incloaks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoonand when he left the building at five o&#8217;clock, he was stillso worried that he walked straight into someone just outside thedoor.
