<P id=HP01CH01M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>But on the edge of town, drills weredriven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usualmorning traffic jam, he couldn&#8217;t help noticing that thereseemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People incloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn&#8217;t bear people who dressed in funnyclothes &#8212; the getups you saw on young people! He supposedthis was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on thesteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdosstanding quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together.Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren&#8217;tyoung at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, andwearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then itstruck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt &#8212;these people were obviously collecting forsomething&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, that would be it. The trafficmoved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in theGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his officeon the ninth floor. If he hadn&#8217;t, he might have found itharder to concentrate on drills that morning. <I class=calibre9>He</I>didn&#8217;t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, thoughpeople down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthedas owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owleven at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal,owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He madeseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was ina very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he&#8217;dstretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun fromthe bakery.
