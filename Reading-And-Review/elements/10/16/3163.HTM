<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what&#8217;s good for you,&#8221; said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn&#8217;t mentioned the date.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid!&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might&#8217;ve been happening while we were there!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn&#8217;t meet Harry&#8217;s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they&#8217;d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he&#8217;d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn&#8217;t want to tell Harry?</P>

<P class=first>Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn&#8217;t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn&#8217;t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday &#8212; and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.
