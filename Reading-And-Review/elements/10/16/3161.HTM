<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push it,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry&#8217;s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He&#8217;d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week &#8212; why did Snape hate him so much?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; said Ron, &#8220;Snape&#8217;s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid&#8217;s voice rang out, saying, &#8220;Back, Fang &#8212; back.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid&#8217;s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hang on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Back, Fang.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.</P>
<P id=HP01CH08M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make yerselves at home,&#8221; said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is Ron,&#8221; Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
