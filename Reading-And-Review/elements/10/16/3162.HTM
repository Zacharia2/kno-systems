<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Another Weasley, eh?&#8221; said Hagrid, glancing at Ron&#8217;s freckles. &#8220;I spent half me life chasin&#8217; yer twin brothers away from the forest.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry&#8217;s knee and drooled all over his robes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch &#8220;that old git.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;An&#8217; as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I&#8217;d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D&#8217;yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can&#8217;t get rid of her &#8212; Filch puts her up to it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry told Hagrid about Snape&#8217;s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But he seemed to really <I class=calibre9>hate</I> me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Rubbish!&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Why should he?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Yet Harry couldn&#8217;t help thinking that Hagrid didn&#8217;t quite meet his eyes when he said that.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How&#8217;s yer brother Charlie?&#8221; Hagrid asked Ron. &#8220;I liked him a lot &#8212; great with animals.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie&#8217;s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:</P>

<P class=noindent>Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
