<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:</P>

<P class=noindent>Questions exploded inside Harry&#8217;s head like fireworks and he couldn&#8217;t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, &#8220;What does it mean, they await my owl?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH04M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Gallopin&#8217; Gorgons, that reminds me,&#8221; said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl &#8212; a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl &#8212; a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Dear Professor Dumbledore,</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Given Harry his letter.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Weather&#8217;s horrible. Hope you&#8217;re well.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Hagrid</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.
