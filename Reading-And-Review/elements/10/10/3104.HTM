<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nah &#8212; can&#8217;t spell it. All right &#8212; Voldemort.&#8221; Hagrid shuddered. &#8220;Don&#8217; make me say it again. Anyway, this &#8212; this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin&#8217; fer followers. Got &#8217;em, too &#8212; some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o&#8217; his power, &#8217;cause he was gettin&#8217; himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn&#8217;t know who ter trust, didn&#8217;t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. terrible things happened. He was takin&#8217; over. &#8217;Course, some stood up to him &#8212; an&#8217; he killed &#8217;em. Horribly. One o&#8217; the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore&#8217;s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn&#8217;t dare try takin&#8217; the school, not jus&#8217; then, anyway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, yer mum an&#8217; dad were as good a witch an&#8217; wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an&#8217; girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst&#8217;ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get &#8217;em on his side before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin&#8217; ter do with the Dark Side.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Maybe he thought he could persuade &#8217;em&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe he just wanted &#8217;em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an&#8217;&#8212; an&#8217;&#8212; &#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s that sad &#8212; knew yer mum an&#8217; dad, an&#8217; nicer people yeh couldn&#8217;t find &#8212; anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You-Know-Who killed &#8217;em. An&#8217; then &#8212; an&#8217; this is the real myst&#8217;ry of the thing &#8212; he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin&#8217; by then. But he couldn&#8217;t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That&#8217;s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh &#8212; took care of yer mum an&#8217; dad an&#8217; yer house, even &#8212; but it didn&#8217;t work on you, an&#8217; that&#8217;s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill &#8217;em, no one except you, an&#8217; he&#8217;d killed some o&#8217; the best witches an&#8217; wizards of the age &#8212; the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts &#8212; an&#8217; you was only a baby, an&#8217; you lived.&#8221;
