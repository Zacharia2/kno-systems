<P class=epubfirstparagraph>To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. chased by Dudley&#8217;s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he&#8217;d managed to make it grow back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn&#8217;t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn&#8217;t he set a boa constrictor on him?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See?&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Harry Potter, not a wizard &#8212; you wait, you&#8217;ll be right famous at Hogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Uncle Vernon wasn&#8217;t going to give in without a fight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I told you he&#8217;s not going?&#8221; he hissed. &#8220;He&#8217;s going to Stonewall High and he&#8217;ll be grateful for it. I&#8217;ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish &#8212; spell books and wands and &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won&#8217;t stop him,&#8221; growled Hagrid. &#8220;Stop Lily an&#8217; James Potter&#8217;s son goin&#8217; ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name&#8217;s been down ever since he was born. He&#8217;s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won&#8217;t know himself. He&#8217;ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!&#8221; yelled Uncle Vernon.
