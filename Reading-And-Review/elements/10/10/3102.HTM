<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where was I?&#8221; said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s not going,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid grunted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A what?&#8221; said Harry, interested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A Muggle,&#8221; said Hagrid, &#8220;it&#8217;s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An&#8217; it&#8217;s your bad luck you grew up in a family o&#8217; the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We swore when we took him in we&#8217;d put a stop to that rubbish,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, &#8220;swore we&#8217;d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You knew?&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;You knew I&#8217;m a &#8212; a wizard?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Knew!&#8221; shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. &#8220;Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that &#8212; that school &#8212; and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was &#8212; a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you&#8217;d be just the same, just as strange, just as &#8212; as &#8212; abnormal &#8212; and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!&#8221;
