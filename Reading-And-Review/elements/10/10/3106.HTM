<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what happened to Vol-, sorry &#8212; I mean, You-Know-Who?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That&#8217;s the biggest myst&#8217;ry, see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was gettin&#8217; more an&#8217; more powerful &#8212; why&#8217;d he go?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he&#8217;s still out there, bidin&#8217; his time, like, but I don&#8217; believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of &#8217;em came outta kinda trances. Don&#8217; reckon they could&#8217;ve done if he was comin&#8217; back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Most of us reckon he&#8217;s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. &#8217;Cause somethin&#8217; about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin&#8217; goin&#8217; on that night he hadn&#8217;t counted on &#8212; I dunno what it was, no one does &#8212; but somethin&#8217; about you stumped him, all right.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He&#8217;d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn&#8217;t they been turned into warty toads every time they&#8217;d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he&#8217;d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I think you must have made a mistake. I don&#8217;t think I can be a wizard.&#8221;
