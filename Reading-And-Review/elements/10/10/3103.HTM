<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, &#8220;Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;CAR CRASH!&#8221; roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. &#8220;How could a car crash kill Lily an&#8217; James Potter? It&#8217;s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin&#8217; his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But why? What happened?&#8221; Harry asked urgently.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The anger faded from Hagrid&#8217;s face. He looked suddenly anxious.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I never expected this,&#8221; he said, in a low, worried voice. &#8220;I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin&#8217; hold of yeh, how much yeh didn&#8217;t know. Ah, Harry, I don&#8217; know if I&#8217;m the right person ter tell yeh &#8212; but someone&#8217;s gotta &#8212; yeh can&#8217;t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin&#8217;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh &#8212; mind, I can&#8217;t tell yeh everythin&#8217;, it&#8217;s a great myst&#8217;ry, parts of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, &#8220;It begins, I suppose, with &#8212; with a person called &#8212; but it&#8217;s incredible yeh don&#8217;t know his name, everyone in our world knows &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; I don&#8217; like sayin&#8217; the name if I can help it. No one does.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Gulpin&#8217; gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Could you write it down?&#8221; Harry suggested.
