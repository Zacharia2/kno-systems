<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;However, recent events must be taken into account.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The room went very still. The Slytherins&#8217; smiles faded a little.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ahem,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;First &#8212; to Mr. Ronald Weasley&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, &#8220;My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall&#8217;s giant chess set!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last there was silence again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Second &#8212; to Miss Hermione Granger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves &#8212; they were a hundred points up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Third &#8212; to Mr. Harry Potter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points &#8212; exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House Cup &#8212; if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.
