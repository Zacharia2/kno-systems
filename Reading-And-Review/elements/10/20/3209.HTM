<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I&#8217;ll need something to look forward to.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bye, Harry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See you, Potter!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Still famous,&#8221; said Ron, grinning at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not where I&#8217;m going, I promise you,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There he is, Mum, there he is, look!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Ginny Weasley, Ron&#8217;s younger sister, but she wasn&#8217;t pointing at Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry Potter!&#8221; she squealed. &#8220;Look, Mum! I can see &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Be quiet, Ginny, and it&#8217;s rude to point.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Busy year?&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, it was nothing, dear.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ready, are you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You must be Harry&#8217;s family!&#8221; said Mrs. Weasley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;In a manner of speaking,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon. &#8220;Hurry up, boy, we haven&#8217;t got all day.&#8221; He walked away.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See you over the summer, then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hope you have &#8212; er &#8212; a good holiday,&#8221; said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, I will,&#8221; said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. &#8220;They don&#8217;t know we&#8217;re not allowed to use magic at home. I&#8217;m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
