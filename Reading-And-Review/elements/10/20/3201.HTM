<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, &#8220;And the Invisibility Cloak &#8212; do you know who sent it to me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah &#8212; your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.&#8221; Dumbledore&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;Useful things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And there&#8217;s something else&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fire away.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Quirrell said Snape &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Professor</I> Snape, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, him &#8212; Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He saved his life.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;What?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; said Dumbledore dreamily. &#8220;Funny, the way people&#8217;s minds work, isn&#8217;t it? Professor Snape couldn&#8217;t bear being in your father&#8217;s debt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father&#8217;s memory in peace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And sir, there&#8217;s one more thing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just the one?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, now, I&#8217;m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that&#8217;s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone &#8212; find it, but not use it &#8212; would be able to get it, otherwise they&#8217;d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott&#8217;s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve rather lost my liking for them &#8212; but I think I&#8217;ll be safe with a nice toffee, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
