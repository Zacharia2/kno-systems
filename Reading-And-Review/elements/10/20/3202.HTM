<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, &#8220;Alas! Ear wax!&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just five minutes,&#8221; Harry pleaded.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Absolutely not.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You let Professor Dumbledore in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But five minutes only.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And she let Ron and Hermione in.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Harry!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to &#8212; Dumbledore was so worried &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The whole school&#8217;s talking about it,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;What really happened?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell&#8217;s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So the Stone&#8217;s gone?&#8221; said Ron finally. &#8220;Flamel&#8217;s just going to die?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that &#8212; what was it? &#8212;&#8216;to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I always said he was off his rocker,&#8221; said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So what happened to you two?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I got back all right,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;I brought Ron round &#8212; that took a while &#8212; and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall &#8212; he already knew &#8212; he just said, &#8216;Harry&#8217;s gone after him, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8217; and hurtled off to the third floor.&#8221;
