<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8212; all &#8212; my &#8212; ruddy &#8212; fault!&#8221; he sobbed, his face in his hands. &#8220;I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn&#8217;t know, an&#8217; I told him! Yeh could&#8217;ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I&#8217;ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an&#8217; made ter live as a Muggle!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid!&#8221; said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. &#8220;Hagrid, he&#8217;d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we&#8217;re talking about, he&#8217;d have found out even if you hadn&#8217;t told him.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh could&#8217;ve died!&#8221; sobbed Hagrid. &#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217; say the name!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;VOLDEMORT!&#8221; Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. &#8220;I&#8217;ve met him and I&#8217;m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it&#8217;s gone, he can&#8217;t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I&#8217;ve got loads.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, &#8220;That reminds me. I&#8217;ve got yeh a present.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a stoat sandwich, is it?&#8221; said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. &#8217;Course, he shoulda sacked me instead &#8212; anyway, got yeh this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH17M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sent owls off ter all yer parents&#8217; old school friends, askin&#8217; fer photos&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. knew yeh didn&#8217; have any&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. d&#8217;yeh like it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t speak, but Hagrid understood.
