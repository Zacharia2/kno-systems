<P id=HP01CH17M03E class=break>Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn&#8217;t have everything in life.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville&#8217;s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (&#8220;I always hope they&#8217;ll forget to give us these,&#8221; said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott&#8217;s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King&#8217;s Cross station.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn&#8217;t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You must come and stay this summer,&#8221; said Ron, &#8220;both of you &#8212; I&#8217;ll send you an owl.&#8221;
