<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;D&#8217;you think he meant you to do it?&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Sending you your father&#8217;s Cloak and everything?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Hermione exploded, &#8220;if he did &#8212; I mean to say &#8212; that&#8217;s terrible &#8212; you could have been killed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry thoughtfully. &#8220;He&#8217;s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don&#8217;t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It&#8217;s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah, Dumbledore&#8217;s off his rocker, all right,&#8221; said Ron proudly. &#8220;Listen, you&#8217;ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course &#8212; you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you &#8212; but the food&#8217;ll be good.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,&#8221; she said firmly.</P>
<P class=break>After a good night&#8217;s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want to go to the feast,&#8221; he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. &#8220;I can, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,&#8221; she said sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn&#8217;t realize how risky feasts could be. &#8220;And you have another visitor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, good,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.
