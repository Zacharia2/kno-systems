<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There are all kinds of courage,&#8221; said Dumbledore, smiling. &#8220;It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn&#8217;t have looked more stunned and horrified if he&#8217;d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Which means,&#8221; Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, &#8220;we need a little change of decoration.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall&#8217;s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry&#8217;s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape&#8217;s feelings toward him hadn&#8217;t changed one jot. This didn&#8217;t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was the best evening of Harry&#8217;s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he would never, ever forget tonight.
