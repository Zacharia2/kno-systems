<P></P>
<P id=HP01CH02M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Up! Get up! Now!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Up!&#8221; she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he&#8217;d had the same dream before.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His aunt was back outside the door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you up yet?&#8221; she demanded.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nearly,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don&#8217;t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy&#8217;s birthday.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry groaned.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221; his aunt snapped through the door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing, nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley&#8217;s birthday &#8212; how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley&#8217;s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise &#8212; unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley&#8217;s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn&#8217;t often catch him. Harry didn&#8217;t look it, but he was very fast.
