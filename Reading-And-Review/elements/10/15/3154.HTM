<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Brocklehurst, Mandy&#8221; went to Ravenclaw too, but &#8220;Brown, Lavender&#8221; became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron&#8217;s twin brothers catcalling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bulstrode, Millicent&#8221; then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry&#8217;s imagination, after all he&#8217;d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Finch-Fletchley, Justin!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;HUFFLEPUFF!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. &#8220;Finnigan, Seamus,&#8221; the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Granger, Hermione!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;GRYFFINDOR!&#8221; shouted the hat. Ron groaned.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you&#8217;re very nervous. What if he wasn&#8217;t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he&#8217;d better get back on the train?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, &#8220;GRYFFINDOR,&#8221; Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to &#8220;MacDougal, Morag.&#8221;
