<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn&#8217;t going at all the way he wanted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Like this,&#8221; he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, &#8220;So &#8212; new Gryffindors! I hope you&#8217;re going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the Cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron&#8217;s becoming almost unbearable &#8212; he&#8217;s the Slytherin ghost.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn&#8217;t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did he get covered in blood?&#8221; asked Seamus with great interest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never asked,&#8221; said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate &#233;clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.
