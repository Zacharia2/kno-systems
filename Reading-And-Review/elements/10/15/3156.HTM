<P id=HP01CH07M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he&#8217;d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore&#8217;s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And now there were only four people left to be sorted. &#8220;Thomas, Dean,&#8221; a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. &#8220;Turpin, Lisa,&#8221; became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron&#8217;s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, &#8220;GRYFFINDOR!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well done, Ron, excellent,&#8221; said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as &#8220;Zabini, Blaise,&#8221; was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Welcome!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
