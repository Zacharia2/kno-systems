<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, &#8220;And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Things didn&#8217;t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus&#8217;s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people&#8217;s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Idiot boy!&#8221; snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. &#8220;I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Take him up to the hospital wing,&#8221; Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You &#8212; Potter &#8212; why didn&#8217;t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he&#8217;d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That&#8217;s another point you&#8217;ve lost for Gryffindor.&#8221;
