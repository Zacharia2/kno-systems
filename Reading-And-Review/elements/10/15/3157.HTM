<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn&#8217;t know whether to laugh or not.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is he &#8212; a bit mad?&#8221; he asked Percy uncertainly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mad?&#8221; said Percy airily. &#8220;He&#8217;s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he&#8217;d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That does look good,&#8221; said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t eaten for nearly five hundred years,&#8221; said the ghost. &#8220;I don&#8217;t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know who you are!&#8221; said Ron suddenly. &#8220;My brothers told me about you &#8212; you&#8217;re Nearly Headless Nick!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy &#8212;&#8221; the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?&#8221;
