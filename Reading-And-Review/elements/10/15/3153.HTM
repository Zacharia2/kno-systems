<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>To achieve their ends.</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>So put me on! Don&#8217;t be afraid!</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>And don&#8217;t get in a flap!</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>You&#8217;re in safe hands (though I have none)</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>For I&#8217;m a Thinking Cap!&#8221;</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So we&#8217;ve just got to try on the hat!&#8221; Ron whispered to Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn&#8217;t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Abbott, Hannah!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment&#8217;s pause &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;HUFFLEPUFF!&#8221; shouted the hat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bones, Susan!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;HUFFLEPUFF!&#8221; shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Boot, Terry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;RAVENCLAW!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
