<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter!&#8221; said Snape suddenly. &#8220;What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione&#8217;s hand had shot into the air.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape&#8217;s lips curled into a sneer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Tut, tut &#8212; fame clearly isn&#8217;t everything.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He ignored Hermione&#8217;s hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let&#8217;s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn&#8217;t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thought you wouldn&#8217;t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys&#8217;, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape was still ignoring Hermione&#8217;s quivering hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Harry quietly. &#8220;I think Hermione does, though, why don&#8217;t you try her?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus&#8217;s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he snapped at Hermione. &#8220;For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren&#8217;t you all copying that down?&#8221;
