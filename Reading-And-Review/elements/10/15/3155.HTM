<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, &#8220;SLYTHERIN!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There weren&#8217;t many people left now.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Moon&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , &#8220;Nott&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , &#8220;Parkinson&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , then a pair of twin girls, &#8220;Patil&#8221; and &#8220;Patil&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , then &#8220;Perks, Sally-Anne&#8221;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , and then, at last &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, Harry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Potter,</I> did she say?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>The</I> Harry Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; said a small voice in his ear. &#8220;Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There&#8217;s talent, oh my goodness, yes &#8212; and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that&#8217;s interesting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So where shall I put you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not Slytherin, eh?&#8221; said the small voice. &#8220;Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it&#8217;s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that &#8212; no? Well, if you&#8217;re sure &#8212; better be GRYFFINDOR!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, &#8220;We got Potter! We got Potter!&#8221; Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he&#8217;d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he&#8217;d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
