<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s your Quidditch team?&#8221; Ron asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; I don&#8217;t know any,&#8221; Harry confessed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What!&#8221; Ron looked dumbfounded. &#8220;Oh, you wait, it&#8217;s the best game in the world &#8212;&#8221; And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he&#8217;d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he&#8217;d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn&#8217;t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin&#8217;s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he&#8217;d shown back in Diagon Alley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re saying all down the train that Harry Potter&#8217;s in this compartment. So it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,&#8221; said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. &#8220;And my name&#8217;s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Think my name&#8217;s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He turned back to Harry. &#8220;You&#8217;ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don&#8217;t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.&#8221;
