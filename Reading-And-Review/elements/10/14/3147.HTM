<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He held out his hand to shake Harry&#8217;s, but Harry didn&#8217;t take it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,&#8221; he said coolly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Draco Malfoy didn&#8217;t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d be careful if I were you, Potter,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;Unless you&#8217;re a bit politer you&#8217;ll go the same way as your parents. They didn&#8217;t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it&#8217;ll rub off on you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Both Harry and Ron stood up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Say that again,&#8221; Ron said, his face as red as his hair.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to fight us, are you?&#8221; Malfoy sneered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Unless you get out now,&#8221; said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We&#8217;ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron &#8212; Ron leapt forward, but before he&#8217;d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle&#8217;s knuckle &#8212; Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they&#8217;d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What has been going on?&#8221; she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
