<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Heads down!&#8221; yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oy, you there! Is this your toad?&#8221; said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Trevor!&#8221; cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid&#8217;s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.</P>

<P class=first>The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry&#8217;s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The firs&#8217; years, Professor McGonagall,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH07M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys&#8217; house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.
