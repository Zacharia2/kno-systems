<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right &#8212; the rest of the school must already be here &#8212; but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Welcome to Hogwarts,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall. &#8220;The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville&#8217;s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron&#8217;s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.
