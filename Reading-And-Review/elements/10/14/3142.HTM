<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron&#8217;s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do they? What, they don&#8217;t move at all?&#8221; Ron sounded amazed. &#8220;Weird!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn&#8217;t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott&#8217;s Every Flavor Beans.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You want to be careful with those,&#8221; Ron warned Harry. &#8220;When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor &#8212; you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bleaaargh &#8212; see? Sprouts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn&#8217;t touch, which turned out to be pepper.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.
