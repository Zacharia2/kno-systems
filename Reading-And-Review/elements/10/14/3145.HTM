<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Whatever House I&#8217;m in, I hope she&#8217;s not in it,&#8221; said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. &#8220;Stupid spell &#8212; George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What House are your brothers in?&#8221; asked Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Gryffindor,&#8221; said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. &#8220;Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll say if I&#8217;m not. I don&#8217;t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know, I think the ends of Scabbers&#8217; whiskers are a bit lighter,&#8221; said Harry, trying to take Ron&#8217;s mind off Houses. &#8220;So what do your oldest brothers do now that they&#8217;ve left, anyway?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he&#8217;d finished school.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Charlie&#8217;s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill&#8217;s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Did you hear about Gringotts? It&#8217;s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don&#8217;t suppose you get that with the Muggles &#8212; someone tried to rob a high security vault.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Really? What happened to them?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such big news. They haven&#8217;t been caught. My dad says it must&#8217;ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don&#8217;t think they took anything, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s odd. &#8217;Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who&#8217;s behind it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; without worrying.
