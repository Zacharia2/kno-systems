<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but have you seen a toad at all?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When they shook their heads, he wailed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;ll turn up,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the boy miserably. &#8220;Well, if you see him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He left.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s so bothered,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;If I&#8217;d brought a toad I&#8217;d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can&#8217;t talk.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The rat was still snoozing on Ron&#8217;s lap.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He might have died and you wouldn&#8217;t know the difference,&#8221; said Ron in disgust. &#8220;I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;ll show you, look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Unicorn hair&#8217;s nearly poking out. Anyway &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Has anyone seen a toad? Neville&#8217;s lost one,&#8221; she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already told him we haven&#8217;t seen it,&#8221; said Ron, but the girl wasn&#8217;t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, are you doing magic? Let&#8217;s see it, then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.
