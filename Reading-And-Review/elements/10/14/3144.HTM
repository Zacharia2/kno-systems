<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; all right.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He cleared his throat.</P>

<P class=noindent>He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you sure that&#8217;s a real spell?&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not very good, is it? I&#8217;ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it&#8217;s all worked for me. Nobody in my family&#8217;s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it&#8217;s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I&#8217;ve heard &#8212; I&#8217;ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough &#8212; I&#8217;m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She said all this very fast.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn&#8217;t learned all the course books by heart either.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m Ron Weasley,&#8221; Ron muttered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry Potter,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you really?&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;I know all about you, of course &#8212; I got a few extra books for background reading, and you&#8217;re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; said Harry, feeling dazed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Goodness, didn&#8217;t you know, I&#8217;d have found out everything I could if it was me,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;Do either of you know what House you&#8217;ll be in? I&#8217;ve been asking around, and I hope I&#8217;m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn&#8217;t be too bad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Anyway, we&#8217;d better go and look for Neville&#8217;s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we&#8217;ll be there soon.&#8221;
