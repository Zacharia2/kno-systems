<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: &#8220;Firs&#8217; years! Firs&#8217; years over here! All right there, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid&#8217;s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;C&#8217;mon, follow me &#8212; any more firs&#8217; years? Mind yer step, now! Firs&#8217; years follow me!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh&#8217;ll get yer firs&#8217; sight o&#8217; Hogwarts in a sec,&#8221; Hagrid called over his shoulder, &#8220;jus&#8217; round this bend here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a loud &#8220;Oooooh!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No more&#8217;n four to a boat!&#8221; Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Everyone in?&#8221; shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. &#8220;Right then &#8212; FORWARD!&#8221;
