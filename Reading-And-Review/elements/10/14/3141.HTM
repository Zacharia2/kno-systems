<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are these?&#8221; Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. &#8220;They&#8217;re not really frogs, are they?&#8221; He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;But see what the card is. I&#8217;m missing Agrippa.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, of course, you wouldn&#8217;t know &#8212; Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect &#8212; famous witches and wizards. I&#8217;ve got about five hundred, but I haven&#8217;t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man&#8217;s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So <I class=calibre9>this</I> is Dumbledore!&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;d never heard of Dumbledore!&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa &#8212; thanks &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry turned over his card and read:</P>
<DIV class=top1>
<P class=center1>&nbsp;<SPAN class=calibre6>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=center><SPAN class=sc>CURRENTLY&nbsp;&nbsp;HEADMASTER&nbsp;&nbsp;OF&nbsp;&nbsp;HOGWARTS</SPAN></P></DIV>
<DIV class=block>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<DIV class=block>
<DIV class=topbot>
<P class=noindent>Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon&#8217;s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore&#8217;s face had disappeared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t expect him to hang around all day,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be back. No, I&#8217;ve got Morgana again and I&#8217;ve got about six of her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you want it? You can start collecting.&#8221;
