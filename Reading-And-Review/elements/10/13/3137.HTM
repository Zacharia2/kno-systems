<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right, keep your hair on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A whistle sounded.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Ginny, we&#8217;ll send you loads of owls.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;George!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Only joking, Mum.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The train began to move. Harry saw the boys&#8217; mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.</P>
<P id=HP01CH06M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn&#8217;t know what he was going to &#8212; but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Anyone sitting there?&#8221; he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. &#8220;Everywhere else is full.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn&#8217;t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hey, Ron.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The twins were back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Listen, we&#8217;re going down the middle of the train &#8212; Lee Jordan&#8217;s got a giant tarantula down there.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right,&#8221; mumbled Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; said the other twin, &#8220;did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bye,&#8221; said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.
