<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you really Harry Potter?&#8221; Ron blurted out.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry nodded.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh &#8212; well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George&#8217;s jokes,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;And have you really got &#8212; you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He pointed at Harry&#8217;s forehead.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So that&#8217;s where You-Know-Who &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t remember it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing?&#8221; said Ron eagerly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are all your family wizards?&#8221; asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; yes, I think so,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;I think Mum&#8217;s got a second cousin who&#8217;s an accountant, but we never talk about him.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So you must know loads of magic already.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I heard you went to live with Muggles,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;What are they like?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Horrible &#8212; well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I&#8217;d had three wizard brothers.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Five,&#8221; said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. &#8220;I&#8217;m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I&#8217;ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left &#8212; Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy&#8217;s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they&#8217;re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it&#8217;s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I&#8217;ve got Bill&#8217;s old robes, Charlie&#8217;s old wand, and Percy&#8217;s old rat.&#8221;
