<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>On the last day of August he thought he&#8217;d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King&#8217;s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; Uncle Vernon?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; I need to be at King&#8217;s Cross tomorrow to &#8212; to go to Hogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon grunted again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Funny way to get to a wizards&#8217; school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t say anything.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where is this school, anyway?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he read.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His aunt and uncle stared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Platform what?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nine and three-quarters.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk rubbish,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon. &#8220;There is no platform nine and three-quarters.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s on my ticket.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Barking,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, &#8220;howling mad, the lot of them. You&#8217;ll see. You just wait. All right, we&#8217;ll take you to King&#8217;s Cross. We&#8217;re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn&#8217;t bother.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why are you going to London?&#8221; Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Taking Dudley to the hospital,&#8221; growled Uncle Vernon. &#8220;Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.&#8221;
