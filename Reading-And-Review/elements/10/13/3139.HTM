<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;His name&#8217;s Scabbers and he&#8217;s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn&#8217;t aff &#8212; I mean, I got Scabbers instead.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron&#8217;s ears went pink. He seemed to think he&#8217;d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he&#8217;d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley&#8217;s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and until Hagrid told me, I didn&#8217;t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You said You-Know-Who&#8217;s name!&#8221; said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. &#8220;I&#8217;d have thought you, of all people &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I just never knew you shouldn&#8217;t. See what I mean? I&#8217;ve got loads to learn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I bet,&#8221; he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, &#8220;I bet I&#8217;m the worst in the class.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be. There&#8217;s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, &#8220;Anything off the cart, dears?&#8221;
