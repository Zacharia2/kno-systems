<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He is,&#8221; said the first twin. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he added to Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Harry Potter,&#8221;</I> chorused the twins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, him,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I mean, yes, I am.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train&#8217;s open door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fred? George? Are you there?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Coming, Mum.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ron, you&#8217;ve got something on your nose.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Mum</I> &#8212; geroff.&#8221; He wriggled free.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?&#8221; said one of the twins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Percy?&#8221; said their mother.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red-and-gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stay long, Mother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?&#8221; said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. &#8220;You should have said something, we had no idea.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,&#8221; said the other twin. &#8220;Once &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Or twice &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A minute &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All summer &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, shut up,&#8221; said Percy the Prefect.
