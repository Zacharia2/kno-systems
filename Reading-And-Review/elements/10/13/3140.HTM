<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, who hadn&#8217;t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron&#8217;s ears went pink again and he muttered that he&#8217;d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry &#8212; but the woman didn&#8217;t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott&#8217;s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble&#8217;s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hungry, are you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Starving,&#8221; said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, &#8220;She always forgets I don&#8217;t like corned beef.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Swap you for one of these,&#8221; said Harry, holding up a pasty. &#8220;Go on &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want this, it&#8217;s all dry,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;She hasn&#8217;t got much time,&#8221; he added quickly, &#8220;you know, with five of us.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go on, have a pasty,&#8221; said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry&#8217;s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
