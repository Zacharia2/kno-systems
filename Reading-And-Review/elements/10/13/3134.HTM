<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.</P>
<P id=HP01CH06M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, &#8220;Gran, I&#8217;ve lost my toad again.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, Neville,&#8221; he heard the old woman sigh.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give us a look, Lee, go on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Want a hand?&#8221; It was one of the red-haired twins he&#8217;d followed through the barrier.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, please,&#8221; Harry panted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oy, Fred! C&#8217;mere and help!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>With the twins&#8217; help, Harry&#8217;s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry&#8217;s lightning scar.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Blimey,&#8221; said the other twin. &#8220;Are you &#8212; ?&#8221;
