<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn&#8217;t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn&#8217;t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.</P>
<P class=break>There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Your new school uniform,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked in the bowl again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize it had to be so wet.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid,&#8221; snapped Aunt Petunia. &#8220;I&#8217;m dyeing some of Dudley&#8217;s old things gray for you. It&#8217;ll look just like everyone else&#8217;s when I&#8217;ve finished.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High &#8212; like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry&#8217;s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.
