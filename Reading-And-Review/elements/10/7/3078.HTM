<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn&#8217;t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon&#8217;s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They stuff people&#8217;s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,&#8221; he told Harry. &#8220;Want to come upstairs and practice?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;The poor toilet&#8217;s never had anything as horrible as your head down it &#8212; it might be sick.&#8221; Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he&#8217;d said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg&#8217;s. Mrs. Figg wasn&#8217;t as bad as usual. It turned out she&#8217;d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn&#8217;t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she&#8217;d had it for several years.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren&#8217;t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.
