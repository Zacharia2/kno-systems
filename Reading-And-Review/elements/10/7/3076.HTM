<P id=HP01CH02M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, &#8220;Brazil, here I come.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thanksss, amigo.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But the glass,&#8221; he kept saying, &#8220;where did the glass go?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn&#8217;t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon&#8217;s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, &#8220;Harry was talking to it, weren&#8217;t you, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, &#8220;Go &#8212; cupboard &#8212; stay &#8212; no meals,&#8221; before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</P>
<P class=break>Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn&#8217;t know what time it was and he couldn&#8217;t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn&#8217;t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He&#8217;d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he&#8217;d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn&#8217;t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn&#8217;t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn&#8217;t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.
