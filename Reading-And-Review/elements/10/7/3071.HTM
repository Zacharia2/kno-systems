<strong><font color="blue">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone : </font></strong>

<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley&#8217;s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry&#8217;s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley&#8217;s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she&#8217;d ever owned.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now what?&#8221; said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he&#8217;d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn&#8217;t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We could phone Marge,&#8221; Uncle Vernon suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn&#8217;t there &#8212; or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn&#8217;t understand them, like a slug.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What about what&#8217;s-her-name, your friend &#8212; Yvonne?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;On vacation in Majorca,&#8221; snapped Aunt Petunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You could just leave me here,&#8221; Harry put in hopefully (he&#8217;d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley&#8217;s computer).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Aunt Petunia looked as though she&#8217;d just swallowed a lemon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And come back and find the house in ruins?&#8221; she snarled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I won&#8217;t blow up the house,&#8221; said Harry, but they weren&#8217;t listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I suppose we could take him to the zoo,&#8221; said Aunt Petunia slowly, &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and leave him in the car.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
