<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported thatthe nation&#8217;s owls have been behaving very unusually today.Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen indaylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birdsflying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable toexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleepingpattern.&#8221; The newscaster allowed himself a grin. &#8220;Mostmysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Goingto be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, Ted,&#8221; said the weatherman, &#8220;Idon&#8217;t know about that, but it&#8217;s not only the owls thathave been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that insteadof the rain I promised yesterday, they&#8217;ve had a downpour ofshooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Nightearly &#8212; it&#8217;s not until next week, folks! But I canpromise a wet night tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all overBritain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks allover the place? And a whisper, a whisper about thePotters&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. Afterall, they normally pretended she didn&#8217;t have a sister.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said sharply. &#8220;Why?&#8221;
