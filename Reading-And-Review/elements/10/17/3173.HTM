<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Funny stuff on the news,&#8221; Mr. Dursley mumbled.&#8220;Owls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shootingstars&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there were a lot of funny-lookingpeople in town today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;So?&#8221;</I> snapped Mrs. Dursley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I just thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was something to dowith&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <I class=calibre9>her</I>crowd.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursleywondered whether he dared tell her he&#8217;d heard the name&#8220;Potter.&#8221; He decided he didn&#8217;t dare. Instead hesaid, as casually as he could, &#8220;Their son &#8212; he&#8217;dbe about Dudley&#8217;s age now, wouldn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s his name again? Howard, isn&#8217;tit?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinkinghorribly. &#8220;Yes, I quite agree.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He didn&#8217;t say another word on the subject as they wentupstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr.Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the frontgarden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Driveas though it were waiting for something.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do withthe Potters? If it did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it got out that theywere related to a pair of &#8212; well, he didn&#8217;t think hecould bear it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly butMr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last,comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if thePotters <I class=calibre9>were</I> involved, there was no reason for them to comenear him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he andPetunia thought about them and their kind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hecouldn&#8217;t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up inanything that might be going on &#8212; he yawned and turned over&#8212; it couldn&#8217;t affect
