<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A letter?&#8221; repeated Professor McGonagall faintly,sitting back down on the wall. &#8220;Really, Dumbledore, you thinkyou can explain all this in a letter? These people will neverunderstand him! He&#8217;ll be famous &#8212; a legend &#8212; Iwouldn&#8217;t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Dayin the future &#8212; there will be books written about Harry&#8212; every child in our world will know his name!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Dumbledore, looking very seriouslyover the top of his half-moon glasses. &#8220;It would be enough toturn any boy&#8217;s head. Famous before he can walk and talk!Famous for something he won&#8217;t even remember! Can&#8217;t yousee how much better off he&#8217;ll be, growing up away from allthat until he&#8217;s ready to take it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,swallowed, and then said, &#8220;Yes &#8212; yes, you&#8217;reright, of course. But how is the boy getting here,Dumbledore?&#8221; She eyed his cloak suddenly as though shethought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid&#8217;s bringing him.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You think it &#8212; <I class=calibre9>wise</I> &#8212; to trust Hagridwith something as important as this?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I would trust Hagrid with my life,&#8221; saidDumbledore.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying his heart isn&#8217;t in the rightplace,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, &#8220;but youcan&#8217;t pretend he&#8217;s not careless. He does tend to&#8212; what was that?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH01M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>A low rumbling sound had broken thesilence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up anddown the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roaras they both looked up at the sky &#8212; and a huge motorcyclefell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
