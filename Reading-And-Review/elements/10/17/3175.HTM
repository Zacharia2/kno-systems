<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemedto be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up inthe air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with alittle pop. He clicked it again &#8212; the next lamp flickeredinto darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until theonly lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in thedistance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyonelooked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, theywouldn&#8217;t be able to see anything that was happening down onthe pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside hiscloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he satdown on the wall next to the cat. He didn&#8217;t look at it, butafter a moment he spoke to it.</P>
<P id=HP01CH01M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fancy seeing you here,Professor McGonagall.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he wassmiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing squareglasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had aroundits eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her blackhair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did you know it was me?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My dear Professor, I&#8217;ve never seen a cat sit sostiffly.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;d be stiff if you&#8217;d been sitting on abrick wall all day,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All day? When you could have been celebrating? I musthave passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh yes, everyone&#8217;s celebrating, all right,&#8221;she said impatiently. &#8220;You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be abit more careful, but no &#8212; even the Muggles have noticedsomething&#8217;s going on. It was on their news.&#8221; She jerkedher head back at the Dursleys&#8217; dark living-room window.&#8220;I heard it. Flocks of owls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shootingstars.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, they&#8217;re not completelystupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down inKent &#8212; I&#8217;ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never hadmuch sense.&#8221;
