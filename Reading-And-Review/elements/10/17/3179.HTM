<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the cornerhe stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once,and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so thatPrivet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabbycat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. Hecould just see the bundle of blankets on the step of numberfour.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good luck, Harry,&#8221; he murmured. He turned on hisheel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which laysilent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you wouldexpect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled overinside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on theletter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, notknowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a fewhours&#8217; time by Mrs. Dursley&#8217;s scream as she opened thefront door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend thenext few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousinDudley.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He couldn&#8217;t know that at thisvery moment, people meeting in secret all over the country wereholding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: &#8220;ToHarry Potter &#8212; the boy who lived!&#8221;</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>N</SPAN>early ten years hadpassed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on thefront step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sunrose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass numberfour on the Dursleys&#8217; front door; it crept into their livingroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the nightwhen Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much timehad passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of whatlooked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-coloredbonnets &#8212; but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and nowthe photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle,on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father,being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at allthat another boy lived in the house, too.
