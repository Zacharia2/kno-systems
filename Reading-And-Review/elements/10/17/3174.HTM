<P class=epubfirstparagraph>How very wrong he was.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, butthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. Itwas sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly onthe far corner of Privet Drive. It didn&#8217;t so much as quiverwhen a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owlsswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the catmoved at all.</P>
<P id=HP01CH01M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>A man appeared on the corner the cathad been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you&#8217;dhave thought he&#8217;d just popped out of the ground. Thecat&#8217;s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He wastall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair andbeard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He waswearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, andhigh-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, andsparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very longand crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. Thisman&#8217;s name was Albus Dumbledore.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Albus Dumbledore didn&#8217;t seem to realize that he had justarrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots wasunwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking forsomething. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, becausehe looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at himfrom the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of thecat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, &#8220;I shouldhave known.&#8221;
