<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Could I &#8212; could I say good-bye to him, sir?&#8221;asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gavehim what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then,suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shhh!&#8221; hissed Professor McGonagall,&#8220;you&#8217;ll wake the Muggles!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;S-s-sorry,&#8221; sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large,spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. &#8220;But Ic-c-can&#8217;t stand it &#8212; Lily an&#8217; James dead &#8212;an&#8217; poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, yes, it&#8217;s all very sad, but get a grip onyourself, Hagrid, or we&#8217;ll be found,&#8221; ProfessorMcGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm asDumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the frontdoor. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out ofhis cloak, tucked it inside Harry&#8217;s blankets, and then cameback to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stoodand looked at the little bundle; Hagrid&#8217;s shoulders shook,Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling lightthat usually shone from Dumbledore&#8217;s eyes seemed to have goneout.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dumbledore finally, &#8220;that&#8217;sthat. We&#8217;ve no business staying here. We may as well go andjoin the celebrations.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Hagrid in a very muffled voice,&#8220;I&#8217;d best get this bike away. G&#8217;night, ProfessorMcGonagall &#8212; Professor Dumbledore, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swunghimself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with aroar it rose into the air and off into the night.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I shall see you soon, I expect, ProfessorMcGonagall,&#8221; said Dumbledore, nodding to her. ProfessorMcGonagall blew her nose in reply.
