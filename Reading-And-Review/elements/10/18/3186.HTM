<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worthbeing with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere thatwasn&#8217;t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg&#8217;scabbage-smelling living room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. Heliked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council,Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favoritesubjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. roaring along like maniacs, the younghoodlums,&#8221; he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I had a dream about a motorcycle,&#8221; said Harry,remembering suddenly. &#8220;It was flying.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turnedright around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like agigantic beet with a mustache: &#8220;MOTORCYCLES DON&#8217;TFLY!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley and Piers sniggered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know they don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;It wasonly a dream.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But he wished he hadn&#8217;t said anything. If there was onething the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, itwas his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn&#8217;t,no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon &#8212; theyseemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded withfamilies. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate icecreams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in thevan had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry himaway, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn&#8217;t bad,either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorillascratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except thatit wasn&#8217;t blond.
