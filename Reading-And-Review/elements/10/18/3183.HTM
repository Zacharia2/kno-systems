<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley&#8217;s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry&#8217;sheart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley&#8217;s birthday, hisparents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks,hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was leftbehind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away.Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs.Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she&#8217;d everowned.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now what?&#8221; said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously atHarry as though he&#8217;d planned this. Harry knew he ought tofeel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn&#8217;teasy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before hehad to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We could phone Marge,&#8221; Uncle Vernon suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly, Vernon, she hates theboy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though hewasn&#8217;t there &#8212; or rather, as though he was somethingvery nasty that couldn&#8217;t understand them, like a slug.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What about what&#8217;s-her-name, your friend &#8212;Yvonne?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;On vacation in Majorca,&#8221; snapped Aunt Petunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You could just leave me here,&#8221; Harry put inhopefully (he&#8217;d be able to watch what he wanted on televisionfor a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley&#8217;scomputer).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Aunt Petunia looked as though she&#8217;d just swallowed alemon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And come back and find the house in ruins?&#8221; shesnarled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I won&#8217;t blow up the house,&#8221; said Harry, butthey weren&#8217;t listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I suppose we could take him to the zoo,&#8221; said AuntPetunia slowly, &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and leave him in thecar.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
