<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had the best morning he&#8217;d had in a long time. He wascareful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudleyand Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals bylunchtime, wouldn&#8217;t fall back on their favorite hobby ofhitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had atantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn&#8217;t have enoughice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry wasallowed to finish the first.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all toogood to last.</P>
<P id=HP01CH02M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>After lunch they went to the reptilehouse. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all alongthe walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes werecrawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley andPiers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushingpythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. Itcould have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon&#8217;s carand crushed it into a trash can &#8212; but at the moment itdidn&#8217;t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring atthe glistening brown coils.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make it move,&#8221; he whined at his father. UncleVernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn&#8217;t budge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do it again,&#8221; Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rappedthe glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozedon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is boring,&#8221; Dudley moaned. He shuffledaway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at thesnake. He wouldn&#8217;t have been surprised if it had died ofboredom itself &#8212; no company except stupid people drummingtheir fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. Itwas worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the onlyvisitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; atleast he got to visit the rest of the house.
