<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry andit was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn&#8217;t make themhappen.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barberslooking as though he hadn&#8217;t been at all, had taken a pair ofkitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost baldexcept for his bangs, which she left &#8220;to hide that horriblescar.&#8221; Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent asleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was alreadylaughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning,however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had beenbefore Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week inhis cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he<I class=calibre9>couldn&#8217;t</I> explain how it had grown back so quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into arevolting old sweater of Dudley&#8217;s (brown with orange puffballs). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smallerit seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a handpuppet, but certainly wouldn&#8217;t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia haddecided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief,Harry wasn&#8217;t punished.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>On the other hand, he&#8217;d gotten into terrible trouble forbeing found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley&#8217;s ganghad been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry&#8217;ssurprise as anyone else&#8217;s, there he was sitting on thechimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter fromHarry&#8217;s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbingschool buildings. But all he&#8217;d tried to do (as he shouted atUncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jumpbehind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposedthat the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.
