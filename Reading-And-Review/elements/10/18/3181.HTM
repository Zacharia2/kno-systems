<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard,but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He lookedeven smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had towear were old clothes of Dudley&#8217;s, and Dudley was about fourtimes bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees,black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses heldtogether with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudleyhad punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about hisown appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shapedlike a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he couldremember, and the first question he could ever remember asking hisAunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Don&#8217;t ask questions</I> &#8212; that was the first rulefor a quiet life with the Dursleys.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over thebacon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Comb your hair!&#8221; he barked, by way of a morninggreeting.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of hisnewspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must havehad more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class puttogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way&#8212; all over the place.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchenwith his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had alarge pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thickblond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petuniaoften said that Dudley looked like a baby angel &#8212; Harry oftensaid that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
