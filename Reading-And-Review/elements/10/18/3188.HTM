<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly,it raised its head until its eyes were on a level withHarry&#8217;s.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>It winked.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone waswatching. They weren&#8217;t. He looked back at the snake andwinked, too.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, thenraised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that saidquite plainly:</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;I get that all the time.&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Harry murmured through the glass, thoughhe wasn&#8217;t sure the snake could hear him. &#8220;It must bereally annoying.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The snake nodded vigorously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where do you come from, anyway?&#8221; Harry asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.Harry peered at it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Boa Constrictor, Brazil.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Was it nice there?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harryread on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. &#8220;Oh, I see&#8212; so you&#8217;ve never been to Brazil?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry madeboth of them jump. &#8220;DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK ATTHIS SNAKE! YOU WON&#8217;T <I class=calibre9>BELIEVE</I> WHAT IT&#8217;SDOING!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Out of the way, you,&#8221; he said, punching Harry inthe ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concretefloor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened&#8212; one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close tothe glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boaconstrictor&#8217;s tank had vanished. The great snake wasuncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. Peoplethroughout the reptile house screamed and started running for theexits.
