<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of someunknown relation coming to take him away, but it had neverhappened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes hethought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed toknow him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in aviolet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with AuntPetunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew theman, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buyinganything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had wavedmerrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coathad actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and thenwalked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all thesepeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried toget a closer look.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley&#8217;sgang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes andbroken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley&#8217;sgang.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escapingDudley&#8217;s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers,Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudleywas the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. Therest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley&#8217;sfavorite sport: Harry Hunting.
