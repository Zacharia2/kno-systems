<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That car&#8217;s new, he&#8217;s not sitting in italone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn&#8217;t reallycrying &#8212; it had been years since he&#8217;d really cried&#8212; but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, hismother would give him anything he wanted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dinky Duddydums, don&#8217;t cry, Mummy won&#8217;t lethim spoil your special day!&#8221; she cried, flinging her armsaround him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don&#8217;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.want&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. t-t-tocome!&#8221; Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. &#8220;Healways sp-spoils everything!&#8221; He shot Harry a nasty grinthrough the gap in his mother&#8217;s arms.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Just then, the doorbell rang &#8212;&#8220;Oh, good Lord,they&#8217;re here!&#8221; said Aunt Petunia frantically &#8212;and a moment later, Dudley&#8217;s best friend, Piers Polkiss,walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face likea rat. He was usually the one who held people&#8217;s arms behindtheir backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cryat once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn&#8217;t believe his luck,was sitting in the back of the Dursleys&#8217; car with Piers andDudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. Hisaunt and uncle hadn&#8217;t been able to think of anything else todo with him, but before they&#8217;d left, Uncle Vernon had takenHarry aside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m warning you,&#8221; he had said, putting hislarge purple face right up close to Harry&#8217;s, &#8220;I&#8217;mwarning you now, boy &#8212; any funny business, anything at all&#8212; and you&#8217;ll be in that cupboard from now untilChristmas.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to do anything,&#8221; said Harry,&#8220;honestly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t believe him. No one ever did.
