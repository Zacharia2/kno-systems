<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge &#8212; and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know what day it is,&#8221; sang Dudley, waddling toward him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The huge eyes blinked and vanished.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know what day it is,&#8221; Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;So you&#8217;ve finally learned the days of the week.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Today&#8217;s your birthday,&#8221; sneered Dudley. &#8220;How come you haven&#8217;t got any cards? Haven&#8217;t you even got friends at that freak place?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,&#8221; said Harry coolly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why&#8217;re you staring at the hedge?&#8221; he said suspiciously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You c-can&#8217;t &#8212; Dad told you you&#8217;re not to do m-magic &#8212; he said he&#8217;ll chuck you out of the house &#8212; and you haven&#8217;t got anywhere else to go &#8212; you haven&#8217;t got any friends to take you &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Jiggery pokery!&#8221; said Harry in a fierce voice. &#8220;Hocus pocus &#8212; squiggly wiggly &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;MUUUUUUM!&#8221; howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. &#8220;MUUUUM! He&#8217;s doing you know what!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn&#8217;t really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn&#8217;t eat again until he&#8217;d finished.
