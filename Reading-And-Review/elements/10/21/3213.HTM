<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry&#8217;s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys&#8217; doorstep eleven years before.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry&#8217;s parents had died in Voldemort&#8217;s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow &#8212; nobody understood why &#8212; Voldemort&#8217;s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother&#8217;s sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys&#8217; story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys hadn&#8217;t even remembered that today happened to be Harry&#8217;s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn&#8217;t been high; they&#8217;d never given him a real present, let alone a cake &#8212; but to ignore it completely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, &#8220;Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.&#8221;
