<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He&#8217;d been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon&#8217;s company made drills).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think we should run through the schedule one more time,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon. &#8220;We should all be in position at eight o&#8217;clock. Petunia, you will be &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;In the lounge,&#8221; said Aunt Petunia promptly, &#8220;waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good, good. And Dudley?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be waiting to open the door.&#8221; Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. &#8220;May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;ll love him!&#8221; cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Excellent, Dudley,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. &#8220;And you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I&#8217;m not there,&#8221; said Harry tonelessly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon nastily. &#8220;I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll announce dinner,&#8221; said Aunt Petunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And, Dudley, you&#8217;ll say &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?&#8221; said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My perfect little gentleman!&#8221; sniffed Aunt Petunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And you?&#8221; said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I&#8217;m not there,&#8221; said Harry dully.
