<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flower beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn&#8217;t have risen to Dudley&#8217;s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe he didn&#8217;t have any friends at Hogwarts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight&#8217;s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!&#8221; snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. &#8220;Upstairs! Hurry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon&#8217;s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.
