<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vernon tells me you&#8217;re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Perfect&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dudley?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How about &#8212; &#8216;We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn&#8217;t see him laughing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And you, boy?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I&#8217;m not there,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Too right, you will,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon forcefully. &#8220;The Masons don&#8217;t know anything about you and it&#8217;s going to stay that way. When dinner&#8217;s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I&#8217;ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I&#8217;ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. We&#8217;ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t feel too excited about this. He didn&#8217;t think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right &#8212; I&#8217;m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,&#8221; he snarled at Harry. &#8220;You stay out of your aunt&#8217;s way while she&#8217;s cleaning.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath:</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Happy birthday to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. happy birthday to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
