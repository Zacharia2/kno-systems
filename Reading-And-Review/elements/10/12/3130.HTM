<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217; you worry, Harry. You&#8217;ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you&#8217;ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it&#8217;s hard. Yeh&#8217;ve been singled out, an&#8217; that&#8217;s always hard. But yeh&#8217;ll have a great time at Hogwarts &#8212; I did &#8212; still do, &#8217;smatter of fact.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;First o&#8217; September &#8212; King&#8217;s Cross &#8212; it&#8217;s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she&#8217;ll know where to find me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. See yeh soon, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.</P>

<H2 id=calibre_pb_2 class=calibre12>THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS</H2>
<P class=first>Harry&#8217;s last month with the Dursleys wasn&#8217;t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn&#8217;t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him &#8212; in fact, they didn&#8217;t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn&#8217;t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.
