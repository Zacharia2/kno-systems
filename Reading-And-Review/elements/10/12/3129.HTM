<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shivered. He wasn&#8217;t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M04E class=break>The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn&#8217;t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn&#8217;t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry&#8217;s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry wasn&#8217;t sure he could explain. He&#8217;d just had the best birthday of his life &#8212; and yet &#8212; he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Everyone thinks I&#8217;m special,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I don&#8217;t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I&#8217;m famous and I can&#8217;t even remember what I&#8217;m famous for. I don&#8217;t know what happened when Vol-, sorry &#8212; I mean, the night my parents died.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.
