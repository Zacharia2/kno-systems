<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s Hagrid,&#8221; said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn&#8217;t. &#8220;He works at Hogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of him. He&#8217;s a sort of servant, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s the gamekeeper,&#8221; said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, exactly. I heard he&#8217;s a sort of savage &#8212; lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s brilliant,&#8221; said Harry coldly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; said the boy, with a slight sneer. &#8220;Why is he with you? Where are your parents?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;re dead,&#8221; said Harry shortly. He didn&#8217;t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, sorry,&#8221; said the other, not sounding sorry at all. &#8220;But they were our kind, weren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They were a witch and wizard, if that&#8217;s what you mean.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They&#8217;re just not the same, they&#8217;ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What&#8217;s your surname, anyway?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, &#8220;That&#8217;s you done, my dear,&#8221; and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,&#8221; said the drawling boy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, &#8220;Hagrid, what&#8217;s Quidditch?&#8221;
