<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin&#8217; how little yeh know &#8212; not knowin&#8217; about Quidditch!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me feel worse,&#8221; said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin&#8217;s.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; and he said people from Muggle families shouldn&#8217;t even be allowed in &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yer not from a Muggle family. If he&#8217;d known who yeh were &#8212; he&#8217;s grown up knowin&#8217; yer name if his parents are wizardin&#8217; folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o&#8217; the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in &#8217;em in a long line o&#8217; Muggles &#8212; look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So what <I class=calibre9>is</I> Quidditch?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s our sport. Wizard sport. It&#8217;s like &#8212; like soccer in the Muggle world &#8212; everyone follows Quidditch &#8212; played up in the air on broomsticks and there&#8217;s four balls &#8212; sorta hard ter explain the rules.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;School Houses. There&#8217;s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o&#8217; duffers, but &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I bet I&#8217;m in Hufflepuff,&#8221; said Harry gloomily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,&#8221; said Hagrid darkly. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn&#8217;t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vol-, sorry &#8212; You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Years an&#8217; years ago,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They bought Harry&#8217;s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
