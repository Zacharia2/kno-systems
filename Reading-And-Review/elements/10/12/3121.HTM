<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hogwarts, dear?&#8221; she said, when Harry started to speak. &#8220;Got the lot here &#8212; another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;Hogwarts, too?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My father&#8217;s next door buying my books and Mother&#8217;s up the street looking at wands,&#8221; said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. &#8220;Then I&#8217;m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don&#8217;t see why first years can&#8217;t have their own. I think I&#8217;ll bully Father into getting me one and I&#8217;ll smuggle it in somehow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Have you got your own broom?&#8221; the boy went on.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Play Quidditch at all?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I do &#8212; Father says it&#8217;s a crime if I&#8217;m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you&#8217;ll be in yet?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I&#8217;ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been &#8212; imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I&#8217;d leave, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mmm,&#8221; said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I say, look at that man!&#8221; said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn&#8217;t come in.
