<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn&#8217;t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217; mention it,&#8221; said Hagrid gruffly. &#8220;Don&#8217; expect you&#8217;ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now &#8212; only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A magic wand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M04S class=epubfirstparagraph>A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.
