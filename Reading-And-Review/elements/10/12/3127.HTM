<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t use them?&#8221; said Mr. Ollivander sharply.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, no, sir,&#8221; said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hmmm,&#8221; said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. &#8220;Well, now &#8212; Mr. Potter. Let me see.&#8221; He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. &#8220;Which is your wand arm?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; well, I&#8217;m right-handed,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hold out your arm. That&#8217;s it.&#8221; He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, &#8220;Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard&#8217;s wand.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. &#8220;Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried &#8212; but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
