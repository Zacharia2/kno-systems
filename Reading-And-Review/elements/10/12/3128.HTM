<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, no &#8212; here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we&#8217;ll find the perfect match here somewhere &#8212; I wonder, now &#8212; yes, why not &#8212; unusual combination &#8212; holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, &#8220;Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how very curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He put Harry&#8217;s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, &#8220;Curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but what&#8217;s curious?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I remember every wand I&#8217;ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather &#8212; just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother &#8212; why, its brother gave you that scar.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry swallowed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things &#8212; terrible, yes, but great.&#8221;
