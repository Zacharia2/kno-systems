<P></P>
<P class=break>Harry woke at five o&#8217;clock the next morningand was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up andpulled on his jeans because he didn&#8217;t want to walk into thestation in his wizard&#8217;s robes &#8212; he&#8217;d change onthe train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure hehad everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in hercage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.Two hours later, Harry&#8217;s huge, heavy trunk had been loadedinto the Dursleys&#8217; car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley intositting next to Harry, and they had set off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They reached King&#8217;s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernondumped Harry&#8217;s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into thestation for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until UncleVernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on hisface.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine &#8212; platformten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but theydon&#8217;t seem to have built it yet, do they?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic numbernine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the onenext to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Have a good term,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon with an evennastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and sawthe Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing.Harry&#8217;s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going todo? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because ofHedwig. He&#8217;d have to ask someone.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He stopped a passing guard, but didn&#8217;t dare mentionplatform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard ofHogwarts and when Harry couldn&#8217;t even tell him what part ofthe country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harrywas being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for thetrain that left at eleven o&#8217;clock, but the guard said therewasn&#8217;t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering abouttime wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According tothe large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left toget on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; hewas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he couldhardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
