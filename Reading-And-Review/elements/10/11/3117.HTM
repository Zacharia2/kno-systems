<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Gringotts,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was &#8212;</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s a goblin,&#8221; said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:</P>

<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Enter, stranger, but take heed</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Of what awaits the sin of greed,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>For those who take, but do not earn,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Must pay most dearly in their turn.</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>So if you seek beneath our floors</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>A treasure that was never yours,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Thief, you have been warned, beware</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Of finding more than treasure there.</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>&#8220;Like I said, yeh&#8217;d be mad ter try an&#8217; rob it,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Morning,&#8221; said Hagrid to a free goblin. &#8220;We&#8217;ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You have his key, sir?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got it here somewhere,&#8221; said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin&#8217;s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.
