<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Vampires? Hags? Harry&#8217;s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two across&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Right, stand back, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.</P>
<P id=HP01CH05M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>The brick he had touched quivered &#8212; it wriggled &#8212; in the middle, a small hole appeared &#8212; it grew wider and wider &#8212; a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; said Hagrid, &#8220;to Diagon Alley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He grinned at Harry&#8217;s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons &#8212; All Sizes &#8212; Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver &#8212; Self-Stirring &#8212; Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;ll be needin&#8217; one,&#8221; said Hagrid, &#8220;but we gotta get yer money first.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, &#8220;Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they&#8217;re mad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium &#8212; Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry&#8217;s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. &#8220;Look,&#8221; Harry heard one of them say, &#8220;the new Nimbus Two Thousand &#8212; fastest ever &#8212;&#8221; There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels&#8217; eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
