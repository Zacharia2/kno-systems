<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, &#8220;The usual, Hagrid?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, Tom, I&#8217;m on Hogwarts business,&#8221; said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry&#8217;s shoulder and making Harry&#8217;s knees buckle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good Lord,&#8221; said the bartender, peering at Harry, &#8220;is this &#8212; can this be &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bless my soul,&#8221; whispered the old bartender, &#8220;Harry Potter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what an honor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m meeting you at last.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So proud, Mr. Potter, I&#8217;m just so proud.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Always wanted to shake your hand &#8212; I&#8217;m all of a flutter.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can&#8217;t tell you, Diggle&#8217;s the name, Dedalus Diggle.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you before!&#8221; said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle&#8217;s top hat fell off in his excitement. &#8220;You bowed to me once in a shop.&#8221;
