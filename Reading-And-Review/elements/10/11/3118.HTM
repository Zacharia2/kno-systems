<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The goblin looked at it closely.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That seems to be in order.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,&#8221; said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. &#8220;It&#8217;s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The goblin read the letter carefully.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, handing it back to Hagrid, &#8220;I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?&#8221; Harry asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell yeh that,&#8221; said Hagrid mysteriously. &#8220;Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore&#8217;s trusted me. More&#8217;n my job&#8217;s worth ter tell yeh that.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in &#8212; Hagrid with some difficulty &#8212; and were off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn&#8217;t steering.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late &#8212; they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
