<P class=noindent>&#8220;Can we buy all this in London?&#8221; Harry wondered aloud.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If yeh know where to go,&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=break>Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how the Muggles manage without magic,&#8221; he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn&#8217;t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn&#8217;t help trusting him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is it,&#8221; said Hagrid, coming to a halt, &#8220;the Leaky Cauldron. It&#8217;s a famous place.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn&#8217;t pointed it out, Harry wouldn&#8217;t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn&#8217;t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn&#8217;t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.
