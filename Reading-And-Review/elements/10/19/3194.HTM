<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And to Harry&#8217;s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Use the boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Use the boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell rounded on Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes &#8212; Potter &#8212; come here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; Quirrell repeated. &#8220;Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry walked toward him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that&#8217;s all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell&#8217;s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.</P>
<P id=HP01CH17M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket &#8212; and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow &#8212; incredibly &#8212; he&#8217;d gotten the Stone.</P>
<P id=HP01CH17M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Quirrell impatiently. &#8220;What do you see?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry screwed up his courage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,&#8221; he invented. &#8220;I &#8212; I&#8217;ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell cursed again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get out of the way,&#8221; he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But he hadn&#8217;t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn&#8217;t moving his lips.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He lies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He lies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
