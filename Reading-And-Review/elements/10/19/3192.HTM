<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,&#8221; Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. &#8220;Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he&#8217;s in London&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#8217;ll be far away by the time he gets back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I saw you and Snape in the forest &#8212;&#8221; he blurted out.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. &#8220;He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I&#8217;d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me &#8212; as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I see the Stone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#8217;m presenting it to my master&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but where is it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn&#8217;t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, he does,&#8221; said Quirrell casually, &#8220;heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn&#8217;t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing &#8212; I thought Snape was threatening you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell&#8217;s face.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I find it hard to follow my master&#8217;s instructions &#8212; he is a great wizard and I am weak &#8212;&#8221;
