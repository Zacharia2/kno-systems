<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You mean he was there in the classroom with you?&#8221; Harry gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He is with me wherever I go,&#8221; said Quirrell quietly. &#8220;I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.&#8221; Quirrell shivered suddenly. &#8220;He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell&#8217;s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley &#8212; how could he have been so stupid? He&#8217;d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell cursed under his breath.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s mind was racing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it &#8212; which means I&#8217;ll see where it&#8217;s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I&#8217;m up to?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.
