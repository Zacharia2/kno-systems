<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, come back here!&#8221; Quirrell shouted. &#8220;Tell me the truth! What did you just see?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The high voice spoke again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let me speak to him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. face-to-face.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Master, you are not strong enough!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I have strength enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt as if Devil&#8217;s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn&#8217;t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell&#8217;s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry would have screamed, but he couldn&#8217;t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell&#8217;s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry Potter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; it whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn&#8217;t move.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See what I have become?&#8221; the face said. &#8220;Mere shadow and vapor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have form only when I can share another&#8217;s body&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why don&#8217;t you give me that Stone in your pocket?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry&#8217;s legs. He stumbled backward.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool,&#8221; snarled the face. &#8220;Better save your own life and join me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or you&#8217;ll meet the same end as your parents.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They died begging me for mercy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
