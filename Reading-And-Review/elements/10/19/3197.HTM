<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell&#8217;s face &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;AAAARGH!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn&#8217;t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain &#8212; his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off &#8212; the pain in Harry&#8217;s head was building &#8212; he couldn&#8217;t see &#8212; he could only hear Quirrell&#8217;s terrible shrieks and Voldemort&#8217;s yells of, &#8220;KILL HIM! KILL HIM!&#8221; and other voices, maybe in Harry&#8217;s own head, crying, &#8220;Harry! Harry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He felt Quirrell&#8217;s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. down&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=break>Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He blinked. It wasn&#8217;t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good afternoon, Harry,&#8221; said Dumbledore.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: &#8220;Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He&#8217;s got the Stone! Sir, quick &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;Quirrell does not have the Stone.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Then who does? Sir, I &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
