<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Tokens from your friends and admirers,&#8221; said Dumbledore, beaming. &#8220;What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How long have I been in here?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But sir, the Stone &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You got there? You got Hermione&#8217;s owl?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was <I class=calibre9>you.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I feared I might be too late.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You nearly were, I couldn&#8217;t have kept him off the Stone much longer &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not the Stone, boy, you &#8212; the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Destroyed?&#8221; said Harry blankly. &#8220;But your friend &#8212; Nicolas Flamel &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, you know about Nicolas?&#8221; said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. &#8220;You did do the thing properly, didn&#8217;t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it&#8217;s all for the best.&#8221;
