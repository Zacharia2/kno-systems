<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of thehouse, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays,where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he wouldbe going off to secondary school and, for the first time in hislife, he wouldn&#8217;t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted atUncle Vernon&#8217;s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkisswas going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going toStonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this wasvery funny.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They stuff people&#8217;s heads down the toilet the firstday at Stonewall,&#8221; he told Harry. &#8220;Want to comeupstairs and practice?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;The poortoilet&#8217;s never had anything as horrible as your head down it&#8212; it might be sick.&#8221; Then he ran, before Dudley couldwork out what he&#8217;d said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy hisSmeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg&#8217;s. Mrs. Figgwasn&#8217;t as bad as usual. It turned out she&#8217;d broken herleg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn&#8217;t seem quiteas fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gavehim a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she&#8217;d hadit for several years.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for thefamily in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroontailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats calledboaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting eachother while the teachers weren&#8217;t looking. This was supposedto be good training for later life.
