<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;LIAR!&#8221; Harry shouted suddenly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How touching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; it hissed. &#8220;I always value bravery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, boy, your parents were brave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but your mother needn&#8217;t have died&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was trying to protect you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;NEVER!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed &#8220;SEIZE HIM!&#8221; and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell&#8217;s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry&#8217;s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened &#8212; he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers &#8212; they were blistering before his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Seize him! SEIZE HIM!&#8221; shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Harry&#8217;s neck &#8212; Harry&#8217;s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Master, I cannot hold him &#8212; my hands &#8212; my hands!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms &#8212; Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Then kill him, fool, and be done!&#8221; screeched Voldemort.
