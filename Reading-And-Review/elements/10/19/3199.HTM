<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But that means he and his wife will die, won&#8217;t they?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry&#8217;s face.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;To one as young as you, I&#8217;m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all &#8212; the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sir &#8212; even if the Stone&#8217;s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort&#8217;s going to try other ways of coming back, isn&#8217;t he? I mean, he hasn&#8217;t gone, has he?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time &#8212; and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.&#8221;
