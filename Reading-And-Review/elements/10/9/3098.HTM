<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Anyway &#8212; Harry,&#8221; said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, &#8220;a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here &#8212; I mighta sat on it at some point, but it&#8217;ll taste all right.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant chuckled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;True, I haven&#8217;t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry&#8217;s whole arm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What about that tea then, eh?&#8221; he said, rubbing his hands together. &#8220;I&#8217;d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh&#8217;ve got it, mind.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn&#8217;t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he&#8217;d sunk into a hot bath.</P>
<P id=HP01CH04M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.&#8221;
