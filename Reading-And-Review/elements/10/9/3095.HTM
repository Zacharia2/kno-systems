<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vernon,&#8221; Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, &#8220;look at the address &#8212; how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re watching the house?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Watching &#8212; spying &#8212; might be following us,&#8221; muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don&#8217;t want &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry could see Uncle Vernon&#8217;s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;No, we&#8217;ll ignore it. If they don&#8217;t get an answer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, that&#8217;s best&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we won&#8217;t do anything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn&#8217;t we swear when we took him in we&#8217;d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he&#8217;d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my letter?&#8221; said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. &#8220;Who&#8217;s writing to me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon shortly. &#8220;I have burned it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was not a mistake,&#8221; said Harry angrily, &#8220;it had my cupboard on it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;SILENCE!&#8221; yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; yes, Harry &#8212; about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#8217;re really getting a bit big for it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley&#8217;s second bedroom.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask questions!&#8221; snapped his uncle. &#8220;Take this stuff upstairs, now.&#8221;
