<strong><font color="blue">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone : </font></strong>

<P></P>
<P class=break>On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?&#8221; Dudley asked Harry in amazement.</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M01S class=break>&nbsp;On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No post on Sundays,&#8221; he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, &#8220;no damn letters today &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Out! OUT!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That does it,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. &#8220;I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We&#8217;re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!&#8221;
