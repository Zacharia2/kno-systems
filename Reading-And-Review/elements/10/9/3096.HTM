<P></P>
<P class=break>On Saturday, things began to <U>get out of hand</U>. Twenty-four letters to Harry <U>found their way</U> into the house, <U>rolled up</U> and hidden inside <U>each of</U> the two <U><STRONG>dozen</STRONG> eggs</U> that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia <STRONG>shredded</STRONG> the letters in her food processor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who <U>on earth </U>wants to talk to you this <STRONG>badly</STRONG>?&#8221; Dudley asked Harry in amazement.</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M01S class=break>&nbsp;On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and <U>rather ill</U>, but happy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No post on Sundays,&#8221; he reminded them cheerfully as he spread <STRONG>marmalade</STRONG> on his newspapers, &#8220;no <STRONG>damn</STRONG> letters today &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something came <U><STRONG>whizzing</STRONG> down</U> the <U>kitchen <STRONG>chimney</STRONG></U> as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters <U>came <STRONG>pelting</STRONG> out of the fireplace</U> like <STRONG>bullets</STRONG>. The Dursleys <STRONG>ducked</STRONG>, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Out! OUT!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon <STRONG>seized</STRONG> Harry around the <STRONG>waist</STRONG> and <STRONG>threw</STRONG> him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon <U><STRONG>slammed</STRONG> the door <STRONG>shut</STRONG></U>. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, <U><STRONG>bouncing</STRONG> off</U> the walls and floor.</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That does it,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak <STRONG>calmly</STRONG> but <U>pulling <STRONG>great tufts</STRONG> out of his <STRONG>mustache</STRONG></U> at the same time. &#8220;I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We&#8217;re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!&#8221;
