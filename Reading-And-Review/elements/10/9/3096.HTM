<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle&#8217;s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn&#8217;t do exactly what he&#8217;d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon&#8217;s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want &#8212;&#8221; he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See,&#8221; he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, &#8220;if they can&#8217;t deliver them they&#8217;ll just give up.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;ll work, Vernon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, these people&#8217;s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they&#8217;re not like you and me,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.</P>
<P class=break>On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn&#8217;t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed &#8220;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&#8221; as he worked, and jumped at small noises.
