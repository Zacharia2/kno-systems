<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vernon,&#8221; Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, &#8220;look at the address &#8212; how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re watching the house?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Watching &#8212; spying &#8212; might be following us,&#8221; <STRONG>muttered</STRONG> Uncle Vernon wildly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don&#8217;t want &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry could see Uncle Vernon&#8217;s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;No, we&#8217;ll ignore it. If they don&#8217;t get an answer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, that&#8217;s best&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we won&#8217;t do anything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not having one in the house, <U>Petunia</U>! Didn&#8217;t we <STRONG>swear</STRONG> when we took him in we&#8217;d <STRONG>stamp out</STRONG> that dangerous <STRONG>nonsense</STRONG>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=break><U>That evening</U> when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he&#8217;d never done before(&lt;-); he visited Harry in his <STRONG>cupboard</STRONG>.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my letter?&#8221; said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had <STRONG>squeezed</STRONG> through the door. &#8220;Who&#8217;s writing to me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon shortly. &#8220;I have <STRONG>burned</STRONG> it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was not a mistake,&#8221; said Harry angrily, &#8220;it had my <STRONG>cupboard</STRONG> on it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;SILENCE!&#8221; <STRONG>yelled</STRONG> Uncle Vernon, and a couple of <STRONG>spiders</STRONG> fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; yes, Harry &#8212; about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#8217;re really getting a bit big for it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley&#8217;s second bedroom.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask questions!&#8221; snapped his uncle. &#8220;Take this <STRONG>stuff</STRONG> upstairs, now.&#8221;
