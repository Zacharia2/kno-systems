<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What world?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;DURSLEY!&#8221; he boomed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like &#8220;Mimblewimble.&#8221; Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But yeh must know about yer mum and dad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, they&#8217;re famous. You&#8217;re famous.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What? My &#8212; my mum and dad weren&#8217;t famous, were they?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh don&#8217; know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yeh don&#8217; know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh don&#8217; know what yeh are?&#8221; he said finally.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An&#8217; you&#8217;ve kept it from him all these years?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Kept <I class=calibre9>what</I> from me?&#8221; said Harry eagerly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;STOP! I FORBID YOU!&#8221; yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Harry &#8212; yer a wizard.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m a what?&#8221; gasped Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A wizard, o&#8217; course,&#8221; said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, &#8220;an&#8217; a thumpin&#8217; good&#8217;un, I&#8217;d say, once yeh&#8217;ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an&#8217; dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An&#8217; I reckon it&#8217;s abou&#8217; time yeh read yer letter.&#8221;
