<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get the mail, Dudley,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make Harry get it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get the mail, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Make Dudley get it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon&#8217;s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and &#8212; a letter for Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives &#8212; he didn&#8217;t belong to the library, so he&#8217;d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:</P>

<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Little Whinging</I></P>

<P class=noindent>The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hurry up, boy!&#8221; shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. &#8220;What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?&#8221; He chuckled at his own joke.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.
