<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley&#8217;s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Don&#8217;t ask questions &#8212; that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Comb your hair!&#8221; he barked, by way of a morning greeting.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way &#8212; all over the place.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel &#8212; Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
