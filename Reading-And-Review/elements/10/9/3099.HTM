<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant chuckled darkly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yer great puddin&#8217; of a son don&#8217; need fattenin&#8217; anymore, Dursley, don&#8217; worry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn&#8217;t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I still don&#8217;t really know who you are.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Call me Hagrid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;everyone does. An&#8217; like I told yeh, I&#8217;m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts &#8212; yeh&#8217;ll know all about Hogwarts, o&#8217; course.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; no,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked shocked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Harry said quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry?&#8221; barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. &#8220;It&#8217;s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren&#8217;t gettin&#8217; yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn&#8217;t even know abou&#8217; Hogwarts, fer cryin&#8217; out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All what?&#8221; asked Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;ALL WHAT?&#8221; Hagrid thundered. &#8220;Now wait jus&#8217; one second!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you mean ter tell me,&#8221; he growled at the Dursleys, &#8220;that this boy &#8212; this boy! &#8212; knows nothin&#8217; abou&#8217;&#8212; about ANYTHING?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren&#8217;t bad.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know some things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can, you know, do math and stuff.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, &#8220;About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents&#8217; world.&#8221;
