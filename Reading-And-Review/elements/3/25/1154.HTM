<P id=HP01CH01M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn&#8217;t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn&#8217;t bear people who dressed in funny clothes &#8212; the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren&#8217;t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt &#8212; these people were obviously collecting for something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn&#8217;t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn&#8217;t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he&#8217;d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
