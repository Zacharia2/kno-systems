<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys&#8217; house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon&#8217;s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn&#8217;t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a<U> small, working tank</U> Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor&#8217;s dog; in the corner was Dudley&#8217;s first-ever <U>television set</U>, which he&#8217;d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large <STRONG>birdcage</STRONG>, which had once held a <STRONG>parrot</STRONG> that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air <STRONG>rifle</STRONG>, which was up on a <STRONG>shelf</STRONG> with the end all <STRONG>bent </STRONG>because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they&#8217;d never been touched.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley <STRONG>bawling</STRONG> at his mother, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want him in there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I need that room&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make him get out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry <STRONG>sighed</STRONG> and <STRONG>stretched</STRONG> out on the bed. Yesterday he&#8217;d have given anything to be up here. Today he&#8217;d <STRONG>rather</STRONG> be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.</P>
<P class=break>Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in <STRONG>shock</STRONG>. He&#8217;d <STRONG>screamed</STRONG>, <STRONG>whacked</STRONG> his father with his <U>Smelting stick</U>, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his <U>tortoise</U> through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn&#8217;t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and <STRONG>bitterly</STRONG> wishing he&#8217;d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
