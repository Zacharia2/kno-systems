<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall&#8217;s voice trembled as she went on. &#8220;That&#8217;s not all. They&#8217;re saying he tried to kill the Potters&#8217; son, Harry. But &#8212; he couldn&#8217;t. He couldn&#8217;t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they&#8217;re saying that when he couldn&#8217;t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort&#8217;s power somehow broke &#8212; and that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore nodded glumly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s true?&#8221; faltered Professor McGonagall. &#8220;After all he&#8217;s done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all the people he&#8217;s killed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he couldn&#8217;t kill a little boy? It&#8217;s just astounding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of all the things to stop him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We can only guess,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;We may never know.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, &#8220;Hagrid&#8217;s late. I suppose it was he who told you I&#8217;d be here, by the way?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;re going to tell me why you&#8217;re here, of all places?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They&#8217;re the only family he has left now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean &#8212; you can&#8217;t mean the people who live here?&#8221; cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. &#8220;Dumbledore &#8212; you can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been watching them all day. You couldn&#8217;t find two people who are less like us. And they&#8217;ve got this son &#8212; I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!&#8221;
