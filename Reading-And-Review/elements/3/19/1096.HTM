<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know you haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. &#8220;But you&#8217;re different. Everyone knows you&#8217;re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You flatter me,&#8221; said Dumbledore calmly. &#8220;Voldemort had powers I will never have.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Only because you&#8217;re too &#8212; well &#8212; noble to use them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky it&#8217;s dark. I haven&#8217;t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, &#8220;The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone&#8217;s saying? About why he&#8217;s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever &#8220;everyone&#8221; was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What they&#8217;re saying,&#8221; she pressed on, &#8220;is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric&#8217;s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are &#8212; are &#8212; that they&#8217;re &#8212; dead.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Lily and James&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&#8217;t believe it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn&#8217;t want to believe it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, Albus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. &#8220;I know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; he said heavily.
