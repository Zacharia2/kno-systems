<P class=noindent>Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.</P>
<P class=break>&nbsp;&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better just to go home, dear?&#8221; Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Daddy&#8217;s gone mad, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s Monday,&#8221; he told his mother. &#8220;The Great Humberto&#8217;s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday &#8212; and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television &#8212; then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry&#8217;s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun &#8212; last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon&#8217;s old socks. Still, you weren&#8217;t eleven every day.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn&#8217;t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he&#8217;d bought.
