<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I warn you &#8212; I&#8217;m armed!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a pause. Then &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>SMASH!</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.</P>
<P id=HP01CH04M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.</P>
<P id=HP01CH04M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t make us a cup o&#8217; tea, could yeh? It&#8217;s not been an easy journey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Budge up, yeh great lump,&#8221; said the stranger.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;An&#8217; here&#8217;s Harry!&#8221; said the giant.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Las&#8217; time I saw you, you was only a baby,&#8221; said the giant. &#8220;Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh&#8217;ve got yer mum&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I demand that you leave at once, sir!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are breaking and entering!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,&#8221; said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon&#8217;s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.
