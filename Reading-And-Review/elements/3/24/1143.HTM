<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh yes, everyone&#8217;s celebrating, all right,&#8221; she said impatiently. &#8220;You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be a bit more careful, but no &#8212; even the Muggles have noticed something&#8217;s going on. It was on their news.&#8221; She jerked her head back at the Dursleys&#8217; dark living-room window. &#8220;I heard it. Flocks of owls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shooting stars.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, they&#8217;re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent &#8212; I&#8217;ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can&#8217;t blame them,&#8221; said Dumbledore gently. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall irritably. &#8220;But that&#8217;s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn&#8217;t, so she went on. &#8220;A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It certainly seems so,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A <I class=calibre9>what</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A lemon drop. They&#8217;re a kind of Muggle sweet I&#8217;m rather fond of.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn&#8217;t think this was the moment for lemon drops. &#8220;As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this &#8216;You-Know-Who&#8217; nonsense &#8212; for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.&#8221; Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. &#8220;It all gets so confusing if we keep saying &#8216;You-Know-Who.&#8217; I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort&#8217;s name.&#8221;
