<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation&#8217;s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.&#8221; The newscaster allowed himself a grin. &#8220;Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, Ted,&#8221; said the weatherman, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that, but it&#8217;s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He&#8217;d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. &#8220;Er &#8212; Petunia, dear &#8212; you haven&#8217;t heard from your sister lately, have you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn&#8217;t have a sister.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said sharply. &#8220;Why?&#8221;
