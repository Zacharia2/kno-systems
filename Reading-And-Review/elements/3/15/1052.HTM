<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday ourstory starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside tosuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happeningall over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his mostboring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as shewrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past thewindow.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, peckedMrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye butmissed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing hiscereal at the walls. &#8220;Little tyke,&#8221; chortled Mr.Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out ofnumber four&#8217;s drive.</P>
<P id=HP01CH01M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>It was on the corner of the streetthat he noticed the first sign of something peculiar &#8212; a catreading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn&#8217;t realize whathe had seen &#8212; then he jerked his head around to look again.There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, butthere wasn&#8217;t a map in sight. What could he have been thinkingof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked andstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around thecorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It wasnow reading the sign that said Privet Drive &#8212; no,<I class=calibre9>looking</I> at the sign; cats couldn&#8217;t read maps <I class=calibre9>or</I>signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat outof his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except alarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
