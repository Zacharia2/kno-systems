<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>M</SPAN>r. and Mrs. Dursley, ofnumber four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they wereperfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last peopleyou&#8217;d expect to be involved in anything strange ormysterious, because they just didn&#8217;t hold with suchnonsense.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, whichmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, althoughhe did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blondeand had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in veryuseful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences,spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudleyand in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had asecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discoverit. They didn&#8217;t think they could bear it if anyone found outabout the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley&#8217;s sister, butthey hadn&#8217;t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursleypretended she didn&#8217;t have a sister, because her sister andher good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it waspossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighborswould say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knewthat the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seenhim. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away;they didn&#8217;t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
