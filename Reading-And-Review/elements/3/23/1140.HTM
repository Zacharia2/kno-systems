<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Funny stuff on the news,&#8221; Mr. Dursley mumbled. &#8220;Owls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shooting stars&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;So?&#8221;</I> snapped Mrs. Dursley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I just thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was something to do with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. her crowd.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he&#8217;d heard the name &#8220;Potter.&#8221; He decided he didn&#8217;t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, &#8220;Their son &#8212; he&#8217;d be about Dudley&#8217;s age now, wouldn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s his name again? Howard, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. &#8220;Yes, I quite agree.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He didn&#8217;t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it got out that they were related to a pair of &#8212; well, he didn&#8217;t think he could bear it.</P>

Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia&#20329;&#22958; thought about them and their kind.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He couldn&#8217;t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on &#8212; he yawned and turned over &#8212; it couldn&#8217;t affect them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
