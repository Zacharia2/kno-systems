<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,&#8221; said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good luck, Harry,&#8221; he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours&#8217; time by Mrs. Dursley&#8217;s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He couldn&#8217;t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: &#8220;To Harry Potter &#8212; the boy who lived!&#8221;</P>

<H2 id=calibre_pb_2 class=calibre12>THE VANISHING GLASS</H2>
<P class=first>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys&#8217; front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets &#8212; but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
