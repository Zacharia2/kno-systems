<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again &#8212; the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pin-pricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn&#8217;t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.</P>

Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did you know it was me?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My dear Professor, I&#8217;ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;d be stiff if you&#8217;d been sitting on a brick wall all day,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
