<P class=epubfirstparagraph>If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild &#8212; long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.</P>
<P id=HP01CH01M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid,&#8221; said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. &#8220;At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,&#8221; said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. &#8220;Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I&#8217;ve got him, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No problems, were there?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, sir &#8212; house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin&#8217; around. He fell asleep as we was flyin&#8217; over Bristol.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is that where &#8212; ?&#8221; whispered Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;He&#8217;ll have that scar forever.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you do something about it, Dumbledore?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Even if I could, I wouldn&#8217;t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well &#8212; give him here, Hagrid &#8212; we&#8217;d better get this over with.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys&#8217; house.
