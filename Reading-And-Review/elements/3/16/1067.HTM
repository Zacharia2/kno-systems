<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best place for him,&#8221; said Dumbledore firmly. &#8220;His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he&#8217;s older. I&#8217;ve written them a letter.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A letter?&#8221; repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. &#8220;Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He&#8217;ll be famous &#8212; a legend &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future &#8212; there will be books written about Harry &#8212; every child in our world will know his name!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. &#8220;It would be enough to turn any boy&#8217;s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won&#8217;t even remember! Can&#8217;t you see how much better off he&#8217;ll be, growing up away from all that until he&#8217;s ready to take it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, &#8220;Yes &#8212; yes, you&#8217;re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?&#8221; She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid&#8217;s bringing him.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You think it &#8212; wise &#8212; to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I would trust Hagrid with my life,&#8221; said Dumbledore.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying his heart isn&#8217;t in the right place,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t pretend he&#8217;s not careless. He does tend to &#8212; what was that?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH01M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky &#8212; and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.
