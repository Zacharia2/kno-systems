<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found alarge fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feetsticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them thatHagrid was behind it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hi, Hagrid, want any help?&#8221; Ron asked, sticking hishead through the branches.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nah, I&#8217;m all right, thanks, Ron.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Would you mind moving out of the way?&#8221; cameMalfoy&#8217;s cold drawl from behind them. &#8220;Are you tryingto earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourselfwhen you leave Hogwarts, I suppose &#8212; that hut ofHagrid&#8217;s must seem like a palace compared to what yourfamily&#8217;s used to.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;WEASLEY!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron let go of the front of Malfoy&#8217;s robes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He was provoked, Professor Snape,&#8221; said Hagrid,sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.&#8220;Malfoy was insultin&#8217; his family.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules,Hagrid,&#8221; said Snape silkily. &#8220;Five points fromGryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn&#8217;t more. Movealong, all of you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree,scattering needles everywhere and smirking.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get him,&#8221; said Ron, grinding his teethat Malfoy&#8217;s back, &#8220;one of these days, I&#8217;ll gethim &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I hate them both,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;Malfoy andSnape.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on, cheer up, it&#8217;s nearly Christmas,&#8221;said Hagrid. &#8220;Tell yeh what, come with me an&#8217; see theGreat Hall, looks a treat.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to theGreat Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick werebusy with the Christmas decorations.
