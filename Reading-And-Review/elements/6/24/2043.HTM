<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See you in a minute, Ihope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he felldown, down, down and &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed onsomething soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to thegloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay!&#8221; he called up to the light thesize of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor,&#8220;it&#8217;s a soft landing, you can jump!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s this stuff?&#8221; were his first words.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it&#8217;shere to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog,but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry&#8217;s otherside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We must be miles under the school,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Lucky this plant thing&#8217;s here, really,&#8221; saidRon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Lucky!&#8221;</I> shrieked Hermione. &#8220;Look atyou both!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had tostruggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had startedto twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry andRon, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creeperswithout their noticing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firmgrip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought topull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, thetighter and faster the plant wound around them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stop moving!&#8221; Hermione ordered them. &#8220;I knowwhat this is &#8212; it&#8217;s Devil&#8217;s Snare!&#8221;
