<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Found the perfect place!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come on! Everyone out!&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Storm forecast for tonight!&#8221; said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. &#8220;And this gentleman&#8217;s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already got us some rations,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, &#8220;so all aboard!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon&#8217;s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Could do with some of those letters now, eh?&#8221; he said cheerfully.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn&#8217;t cheer him up at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.
