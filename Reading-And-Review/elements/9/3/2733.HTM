<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See?&#8221; Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludgerback into the crate and strapping it down safely. &#8220;TheBludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms.That&#8217;s why you have two Beaters on each team &#8212; theWeasley twins are ours &#8212; it&#8217;s their job to protecttheir side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward theother team. So &#8212; think you&#8217;ve got all that?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeperguards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from theirteam,&#8221; Harry reeled off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Wood.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?&#8221;Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never at Hogwarts. We&#8217;ve had a couple of brokenjaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the teamis the Seeker. That&#8217;s you. And you don&#8217;t have to worryabout the Quaffle or the Bludgers &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; unless they crack my head open.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match forthe Bludgers &#8212; I mean, they&#8217;re like a pair of humanBludgers themselves.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and lastball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny,about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had littlefluttering silver wings.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;This,&#8221;</I> said Wood, &#8220;is the GoldenSnitch, and it&#8217;s the most important ball of the lot.It&#8217;s very hard to catch because it&#8217;s so fast anddifficult to see. It&#8217;s the Seeker&#8217;s job to catch it.You&#8217;ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team&#8217;sSeeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his teaman extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.That&#8217;s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditchonly ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages&#8212; I think the record is three months, they had to keepbringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.
