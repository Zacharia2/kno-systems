<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s it &#8212; any questions?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right,it was doing it that was going to be the problem.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We won&#8217;t practice with the Snitch yet,&#8221; saidWood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate,&#8220;it&#8217;s too dark, we might lose it. Let&#8217;s try youout with a few of these.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and afew minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwingthe golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry tocatch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn&#8217;tcarry on.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That Quidditch Cup&#8217;ll have our name on it thisyear,&#8221; said Wood happily as they trudged back up to thecastle. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you turn out betterthan Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if hehadn&#8217;t gone off chasing dragons.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, whatwith Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all hishomework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized thathe&#8217;d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle feltmore like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, werebecoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered thebasics.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>On Halloween morning they woke to thedelicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thoughtthey were ready to start making objects fly, something they had allbeen dying to try since they&#8217;d seen him make Neville&#8217;stoad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the classinto pairs to practice. Harry&#8217;s partner was Seamus Finnigan(which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch hiseye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It washard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. Shehadn&#8217;t spoken to either of them since the day Harry&#8217;sbroomstick had arrived.
