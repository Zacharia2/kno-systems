<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t forget that nice wrist movementwe&#8217;ve been practicing!&#8221; squeaked Professor Flitwick,perched on top of his pile of books as usual. &#8220;Swish andflick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic wordsproperly is very important, too &#8212; never forget WizardBaruffio, who said &#8216;s&#8217; instead of &#8216;f&#8217; andfound himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, butthe feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay onthe desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with hiswand and set fire to it &#8212; Harry had to put it out with hishat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron, at the next table, wasn&#8217;t having much more luck.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Wingardium Leviosa!&#8221;</I> he shouted, waving hislong arms like a windmill.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re saying it wrong,&#8221; Harry heard Hermionesnap. &#8220;It&#8217;s Wing-<I class=calibre9>gar</I>-dium Levi-<I class=calibre9>o</I>-sa, makethe &#8216;gar&#8217; nice and long.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You do it, then, if you&#8217;re so clever,&#8221; Ronsnarled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand,and said, <I class=calibre9>&#8220;Wingardium Leviosa!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feetabove their heads.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, well done!&#8221; cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.&#8220;Everyone see here, Miss Granger&#8217;s done it!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder no one canstand her,&#8221; he said to Harry as they pushed their way intothe crowded corridor, &#8220;she&#8217;s a nightmare,honestly.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It wasHermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face &#8212; and wasstartled to see that she was in tears.
