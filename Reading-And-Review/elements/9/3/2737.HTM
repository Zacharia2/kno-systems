<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How could a troll get in?&#8221; Harry asked as theyclimbed the stairs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, they&#8217;re supposed to be reallystupid,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Maybe Peeves let it in for aHalloween joke.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They passed different groups of people hurrying in differentdirections. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confusedHufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron&#8217;s arm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just thought &#8212; Hermione.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What about her?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know about the troll.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron bit his lip.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;ButPercy&#8217;d better not see us.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way,slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward thegirls&#8217; bathroom. They had just turned the corner when theyheard quick footsteps behind them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Percy!&#8221; hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a largestone griffin.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. Hecrossed the corridor and disappeared from view.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing?&#8221; Harry whispered. &#8220;Whyisn&#8217;t he down in the dungeons with the rest of theteachers?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Search me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor afterSnape&#8217;s fading footsteps.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s heading for the third floor,&#8221; Harrysaid, but Ron held up his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can you smell something?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixtureof old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems toclean.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>And then they heard it &#8212; a lowgrunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed&#8212; at the end of a passage to the left, something huge wasmoving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as itemerged into a patch of moonlight.
