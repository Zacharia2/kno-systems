<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull,granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its smallbald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick astree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it wasincredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged alongthe floor because its arms were so long.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. Itwaggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouchedslowly into the room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The key&#8217;s in the lock,&#8221; Harry muttered.&#8220;We could lock it in.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Ron nervously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the trollwasn&#8217;t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harrymanaged to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up thepassage, but as they reached the corner they heard something thatmade their hearts stop &#8212; a high, petrified scream &#8212; andit was coming from the chamber they&#8217;d just chained up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s the girls&#8217; bathroom!&#8221; Harrygasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Hermione!&#8221;</I> they said together.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice didthey have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door andturned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door openand they ran inside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite,looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing onher, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.
