<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three Chasers,&#8221; Harry repeated, as Wood took out abright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This ball&#8217;s called the Quaffle,&#8221; said Wood.&#8220;The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and getit through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every timethe Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through thehoops to score,&#8221; Harry recited. &#8220;So &#8212;that&#8217;s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops,isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s basketball?&#8221; said Wood curiously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Harry quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s another player on each sidewho&#8217;s called the Keeper &#8212; I&#8217;m Keeper forGryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other teamfrom scoring.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three Chasers, one Keeper,&#8221; said Harry, who wasdetermined to remember it all. &#8220;And they play with theQuaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?&#8221; He pointed atthe three balls left inside the box.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you now,&#8221; said Wood. &#8220;Takethis.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseballbat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to show you what the Bludgers do,&#8221;Wood said. &#8220;These two are the Bludgers.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightlysmaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to bestraining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stand back,&#8221; Wood warned Harry. He bent down andfreed one of the Bludgers.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then peltedstraight at Harry&#8217;s face. Harry swung at it with the bat tostop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away intothe air &#8212; it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood,who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
