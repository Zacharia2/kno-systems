<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled ontoHarry&#8217;s bedspread.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thoughtit looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, ithad a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousandwritten in gold near the top.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>As seven o&#8217;clock drew nearer,Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditchfield. He&#8217;d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds ofseats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectatorswere high enough to see what was going on. At either end of thefield were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They remindedHarry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubblesthrough, except that they were fifty feet high.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted hisbroomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling &#8212;he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and downthe field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at hislightest touch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hey, Potter, come down!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crateunder his arm. Harry landed next to him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very nice,&#8221; said Wood, his eyes glinting. &#8220;Isee what McGonagall meant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you really are anatural. I&#8217;m just going to teach you the rules this evening,then you&#8217;ll be joining team practice three times aweek.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Wood. &#8220;Now, Quidditch is easyenough to understand, even if it&#8217;s not too easy to play.There are seven players on each side. Three of them are calledChasers.&#8221;
