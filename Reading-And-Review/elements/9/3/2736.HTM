<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think she heard you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So?&#8221; said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.&#8220;She must&#8217;ve noticed she&#8217;s got nofriends.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione didn&#8217;t turn up for the next class andwasn&#8217;t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the GreatHall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patiltelling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in thegirls&#8217; bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked stillmore awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the GreatHall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of theirminds.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling whilea thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, makingthe candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly onthe golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when ProfessorQuirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terroron his face. Everyone stared as he reached ProfessorDumbledore&#8217;s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped,&#8220;Troll &#8212; in the dungeons &#8212; thought you ought toknow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackersexploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore&#8217;s wand tobring silence.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Prefects,&#8221; he rumbled, &#8220;lead your Houses backto the dormitories immediately!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Percy was in his element.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fearthe troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Makeway, first years coming through! Excuse me, I&#8217;m aprefect!&#8221;
