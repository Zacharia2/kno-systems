<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The club flew suddenly out of the troll&#8217;s hand, rose high,high up into the air, turned slowly over &#8212; and dropped, witha sickening crack, onto its owner&#8217;s head. The troll swayed onthe spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made thewhole room tremble.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron wasstanding there with his wand still raised, staring at what he haddone.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Hermione who spoke first.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is it &#8212; dead?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I thinkit&#8217;s just been knocked out.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll&#8217;s nose.It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Urgh &#8211; troll boogers.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He wiped it on the troll&#8217;s trousers.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them lookup. They hadn&#8217;t realized what a racket they had been making,but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes andthe troll&#8217;s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall hadcome bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, withQuirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet,clutching his heart.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking atRon and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lipswere white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor fadedquickly from Harry&#8217;s mind.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What on earth were you thinking of?&#8221; said ProfessorMcGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, whowas still standing with his wand in the air. &#8220;You&#8217;relucky you weren&#8217;t killed. Why aren&#8217;t you in yourdormitory?&#8221;
