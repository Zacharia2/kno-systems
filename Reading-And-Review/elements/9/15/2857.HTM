<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, UncleVernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at anymoment, because Harry Potter <I class=calibre9>wasn&#8217;t</I> a normal boy. As amatter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry Potter was a wizard &#8212; a wizard fresh from his firstyear at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if theDursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it wasnothing to how Harry felt.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constantstomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways andghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master),the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall,sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visitingthe gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forestin the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sportin the Wizarding world (six tall goalposts, four flying balls, andfourteen players on broomsticks).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All Harry&#8217;s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, andtop-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in acupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry hadcome home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place onthe House Quidditch team because he hadn&#8217;t practiced allsummer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to schoolwithout any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizardscalled Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and asfar as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was amatter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlockedHarry&#8217;s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her fromcarrying messages to anyone in the Wizarding world.
