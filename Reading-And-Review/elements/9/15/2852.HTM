<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the starsoverhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the otherprefects, &#8220;My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Gotpast McGonagall&#8217;s giant chess set!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last there was silence again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Second &#8212; to Miss HermioneGranger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the use of cool logic in the faceof fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspectedshe had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table werebeside themselves &#8212; they were a hundred points up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Third &#8212; to Mr. HarryPotter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; said Dumbledore. The room wentdeadly quiet. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for pure nerve and outstandingcourage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yellingthemselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred andseventy-two points &#8212; exactly the same as Slytherin. They hadtied for the House Cup &#8212; if only Dumbledore had given Harryjust one more point.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There are all kinds of courage,&#8221; said Dumbledore,smiling. &#8220;It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to ourenemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I thereforeaward ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thoughtsome sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise thaterupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stoodup to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappearedunder a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as apoint for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron inthe ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn&#8217;t have looked morestunned and horrified if he&#8217;d just had the Body-Bind Curseput on him.
