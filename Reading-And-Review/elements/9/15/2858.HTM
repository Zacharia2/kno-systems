<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernonwas large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; AuntPetunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, andporky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, withbrilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. Hewore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin,lightning-shaped scar.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, evenfor a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry&#8217;s verymysterious past, of the reason he had been left on theDursleys&#8217; doorstep eleven years before.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a cursefrom the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whosename most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry&#8217;sparents had died in Voldemort&#8217;s attack, but Harry had escapedwith his lightning scar, and somehow &#8212; nobody understood why&#8212; Voldemort&#8217;s powers had been destroyed the instant hehad failed to kill Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother&#8217;s sisterand her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, neverunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaningto, believing the Dursleys&#8217; story that he had got his scar inthe car crash that had killed his parents.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, andthe whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place atwizard school, where he and his scar werefamous&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but now the school year was over, andhe was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treatedlike a dog that had rolled in something smelly.
