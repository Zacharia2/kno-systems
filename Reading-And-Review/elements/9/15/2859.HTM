<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Dursleys hadn&#8217;t even remembered that today happened tobe Harry&#8217;s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopeshadn&#8217;t been high; they&#8217;d never given him a realpresent, let alone a cake &#8212; but to ignore itcompletely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly andsaid, &#8220;Now, as we all know, today is a very importantday.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of mycareer,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry went back to his toast. <I class=calibre9>Of course,</I> he thoughtbitterly, <I class=calibre9>Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinnerparty.</I> He&#8217;d been talking of nothing else for two weeks.Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and UncleVernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (UncleVernon&#8217;s company made drills).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think we should run through the schedule one moretime,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon. &#8220;We should all be in positionat eight o&#8217;clock. Petunia, you will be &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;In the lounge,&#8221; said Aunt Petunia promptly,&#8220;waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good, good. And Dudley?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be waiting to open the door.&#8221; Dudley puton a foul, simpering smile. &#8220;May I take your coats, Mr. andMrs. Mason?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;ll <I class=calibre9>love</I> him!&#8221; cried Aunt Petuniarapturously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Excellent, Dudley,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon. Then herounded on Harry. &#8220;And <I class=calibre9>you</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in my bedroom, making no noise andpretending I&#8217;m not there,&#8221; said Harry tonelessly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon nastily. &#8220;I willlead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour themdrinks. At eight-fifteen &#8212;&#8221;
