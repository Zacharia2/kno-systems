<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybodystarted talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ronand Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the factthat people were standing up to look at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble diedaway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Another year gone!&#8221; Dumbledore said cheerfully.&#8220;And I must trouble you with an old man&#8217;s wheezingwaffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What ayear it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller thanthey were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you have the whole summer ahead toget them nice and empty before next yearstarts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needsawarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor,with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, withthree hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred andtwenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherintable. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on thetable. It was a sickening sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,&#8221; said Dumbledore.&#8220;However, recent events must be taken intoaccount.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The room went very still. The Slytherins&#8217; smiles faded alittle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ahem,&#8221; said Dumbledore. &#8220;I have a fewlast-minute points to dish out. Let me see.Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;First &#8212; to Mr. RonaldWeasley&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a badsunburn.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the best-played game of chessHogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fiftypoints.&#8221;
