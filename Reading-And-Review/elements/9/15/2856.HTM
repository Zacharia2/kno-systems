<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,loud belch from the Dursleys&#8217; son, Dudley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want more bacon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s more in the frying pan, sweetums,&#8221;said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. &#8220;Wemust build you up while we&#8217;ve got thechance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#8217;t like the sound of thatschool food.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when <I class=calibre9>I</I> wasat Smeltings,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon heartily. &#8220;Dudley getsenough, don&#8217;t you, son?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side ofthe kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Pass the frying pan.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten the magic word,&#8221; said Harryirritably.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family wasincredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash thatshook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream andclapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,veins throbbing in his temples.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I meant &#8216;please&#8217;!&#8221; said Harry quickly.&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,&#8221; thundered his uncle,spraying spit over the table, &#8220;ABOUT SAYING THE&#8216;M&#8217; WORD IN OUR HOUSE?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But I &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!&#8221; roared Uncle Vernon,pounding the table with his fist.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I just &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOURABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, whowas trying to heave Dudley to his feet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;<I class=calibre9>allright</I>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinocerosand watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharpeyes.
