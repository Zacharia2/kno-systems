<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Which means,&#8221; Dumbledore called over the storm ofapplause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating thedownfall of Slytherin, &#8220;we need a little change ofdecoration.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings becamescarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpentvanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape wasshaking Professor McGonagall&#8217;s hand, with a horrible, forcedsmile. He caught Harry&#8217;s eye and Harry knew at once thatSnape&#8217;s feelings toward him hadn&#8217;t changed one jot.This didn&#8217;t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would beback to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was atHogwarts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was the best evening of Harry&#8217;s life, better thanwinning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountaintrolls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he would never, ever forgettonight.</P>
<P id=HP01CH17M03E class=break>Harry had almostforgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come theydid. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with goodmarks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up forhis abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almostas stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed,too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn&#8217;t haveeverything in life.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks werepacked, Neville&#8217;s toad was found lurking in a corner of thetoilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not touse magic over the holidays (&#8220;I always hope they&#8217;llforget to give us these,&#8221; said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagridwas there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailedacross the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talkingand laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eatingBertie Bott&#8217;s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggletowns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets andcoats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters atKing&#8217;s Cross station.
