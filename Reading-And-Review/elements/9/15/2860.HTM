<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll announce dinner,&#8221; said Aunt Petunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And, Dudley, you&#8217;ll say &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs.Mason?&#8221; said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisiblewoman.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My perfect little gentleman!&#8221; sniffed AuntPetunia.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And <I class=calibre9>you</I>?&#8221; said Uncle Vernon viciously toHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in my room, making no noise and pretendingI&#8217;m not there,&#8221; said Harry dully.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few goodcompliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Vernon tells me you&#8217;re a <I class=calibre9>wonderful</I> golfer,Mr. Mason.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <I class=calibre9>Do</I> tell me where you boughtyour dress, Mrs. Mason.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Perfect&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dudley?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How about &#8212; &#8216;We had to write an essay aboutour hero at school, Mr. Mason, and <I class=calibre9>I</I> wrote about<I class=calibre9>you.</I>&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petuniaburst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under thetable so they wouldn&#8217;t see him laughing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And you, boy?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in my room, making no noise and pretendingI&#8217;m not there,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Too right, you will,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon forcefully.&#8220;The Masons don&#8217;t know anything about you andit&#8217;s going to stay that way. When dinner&#8217;s over, youtake Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, andI&#8217;ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck,I&#8217;ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.We&#8217;ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this timetomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t feel too excited about this. Hedidn&#8217;t think the Dursleys would like him any better inMajorca than they did on Privet Drive.
