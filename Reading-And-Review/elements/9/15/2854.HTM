<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. Awizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them gothrough the gate in twos and threes so they didn&#8217;t attractattention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarmingthe Muggles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You must come and stay this summer,&#8221; said Ron,&#8220;both of you &#8212; I&#8217;ll send you an owl.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I&#8217;ll needsomething to look forward to.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gatewayback to the Muggle world. Some of them called:</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bye, Harry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See you, Potter!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Still famous,&#8221; said Ron, grinning at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not where I&#8217;m going, I promise you,&#8221; saidHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There he is, Mum, there he is, look!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Ginny Weasley, Ron&#8217;s younger sister, but shewasn&#8217;t pointing at Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry Potter!&#8221; she squealed. &#8220;Look, Mum! Ican see &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Be quiet, Ginny, and it&#8217;s rude to point.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Busy year?&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Thanks for the fudge andthe sweater, Mrs. Weasley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, it was nothing, dear.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ready, are you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, stilllooking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage ina station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petuniaand Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You must be Harry&#8217;s family!&#8221; said Mrs.Weasley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;In a manner of speaking,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon.&#8220;Hurry up, boy, we haven&#8217;t got all day.&#8221; Hewalked away.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
