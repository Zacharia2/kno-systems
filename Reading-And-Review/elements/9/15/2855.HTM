<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>N</SPAN>ot for the first time,an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, PrivetDrive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of themorning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry&#8217;sroom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Third time this week!&#8221; he roared across the table.&#8220;If you can&#8217;t control that owl, it&#8217;ll have togo!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried, yet again, to explain.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;She&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>bored,</I>&#8221; he said.&#8220;She&#8217;s used to flying around outside. If I could justlet her out at night &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do I look stupid?&#8221; snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit offried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. &#8220;I knowwhat&#8217;ll happen if that owl&#8217;s let out.&#8221;
