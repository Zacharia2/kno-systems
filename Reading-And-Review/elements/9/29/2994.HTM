<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something very painful was going on in Harry&#8217;s mind. AsHagrid&#8217;s story came to a close, he saw again the blindingflash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered itbefore &#8212; and he remembered something else, for the first timein his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid was watching him sadly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Took yeh from the ruined house myself, onDumbledore&#8217;s orders. Brought yeh ter thislot&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Load of old tosh,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped;he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernoncertainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring atHagrid and his fists were clenched.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, you listen here, boy,&#8221; he snarled, &#8220;Iaccept there&#8217;s something strange about you, probably nothinga good beating wouldn&#8217;t have cured &#8212; and as for allthis about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it,and the world&#8217;s better off without them in my opinion &#8212;asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types&#8212; just what I expected, always knew they&#8217;d come to asticky end &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew abattered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at UncleVernon like a sword, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m warning you, Dursley&#8212; I&#8217;m warning you &#8212; one moreword&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by abearded giant, Uncle Vernon&#8217;s courage failed again; heflattened himself against the wall and fell silent.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; said Hagrid, breathingheavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time saggedright down to the floor.
