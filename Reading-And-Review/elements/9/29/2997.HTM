<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella andwhirled it over his head, &#8220;NEVER &#8212;&#8221; he thundered,&#8220;&#8212; INSULT &#8212; ALBUS &#8212; DUMBLEDORE &#8212; IN&#8212; FRONT &#8212; OF &#8212; ME!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to pointat Dudley &#8212; there was a flash of violet light, a sound like afirecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley wasdancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom,howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curlypig&#8217;s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into theother room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammedthe door behind them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;ta lost me temper,&#8221; he said ruefully,&#8220;but it didn&#8217;t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into apig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway therewasn&#8217;t much left ter do.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.</P>
