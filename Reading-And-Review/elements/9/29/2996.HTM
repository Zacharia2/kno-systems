<P class=epubfirstparagraph>To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you wasscared or angry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think aboutit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. every odd thing that had ever made his auntand uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had beenupset or angry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. chased by Dudley&#8217;s gang,he had somehow found himself out of theirreach&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dreading going to school with thatridiculous haircut, he&#8217;d managed to make it growback&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the very last time Dudley had hithim, hadn&#8217;t he got his revenge, without even realizing he wasdoing it? Hadn&#8217;t he set a boa constrictor on him?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid waspositively beaming at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See?&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Harry Potter, not awizard &#8212; you wait, you&#8217;ll be right famous atHogwarts.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Uncle Vernon wasn&#8217;t going to give in without afight.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won&#8217;tstop him,&#8221; growled Hagrid. &#8220;Stop Lily an&#8217; JamesPotter&#8217;s son goin&#8217; ter Hogwarts!
