<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds ofthem.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what happened to Vol-, sorry &#8212; I mean,You-Know-Who?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same nighthe tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That&#8217;s thebiggest myst&#8217;ry, see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he wasgettin&#8217; more an&#8217; more powerful &#8212; why&#8217;d hego?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if hehad enough human left in him to die. Some say he&#8217;s still outthere, bidin&#8217; his time, like, but I don&#8217; believe it.People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of &#8217;emcame outta kinda trances. Don&#8217; reckon they could&#8217;vedone if he was comin&#8217; back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Most of us reckon he&#8217;s still out there somewherebut lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. &#8217;Causesomethin&#8217; about you finished him, Harry. There wassomethin&#8217; goin&#8217; on that night he hadn&#8217;t countedon &#8212; <I class=calibre9>I</I> dunno what it was, no one does &#8212; butsomethin&#8217; about you stumped him, all right.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in hiseyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quitesure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could hepossibly be? He&#8217;d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, andbullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really awizard, why hadn&#8217;t they been turned into warty toads everytime they&#8217;d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he&#8217;donce defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudleyhad always been able to kick him around like a football?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I think you musthave made a mistake. I don&#8217;t think I can be awizard.&#8221;
