<P class=noindent>Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl,which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owlout into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though thiswas as normal as talking on the telephone.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where was I?&#8221; said Hagrid, but at that moment,Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved intothe firelight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s not going,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid grunted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d like ter see a great Muggle like you stophim,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A what?&#8221; said Harry, interested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A Muggle,&#8221; said Hagrid, &#8220;it&#8217;s what wecall nonmagic folk like them. An&#8217; it&#8217;s your bad luckyou grew up in a family o&#8217; the biggest Muggles I ever laideyes on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We swore when we took him in we&#8217;d put a stop tothat rubbish,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, &#8220;swore we&#8217;dstamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You <I class=calibre9>knew</I>?&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;You<I class=calibre9>knew</I> I&#8217;m a &#8212; a wizard?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Knew!&#8221; shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly.&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Knew</I>! Of course we knew! How could you not be, mydratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just likethat and disappeared off to that &#8212; that <I class=calibre9>school</I> &#8212;and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn,turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for whatshe was &#8212; a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, itwas Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch inthe family!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. Itseemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.
