<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>H</SPAN>arry woke early thenext morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept hiseyes shut tight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was a dream,&#8221; he told himself firmly. &#8220;Idreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to aschool for wizards. When I open my eyes I&#8217;ll be at home in mycupboard.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>And there&#8217;s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,</I>Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn&#8217;t openhis eyes. It had been such a good dream.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Tap. Tap. Tap.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Harry mumbled, &#8220;I&#8217;m gettingup.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He sat up and Hagrid&#8217;s heavy coat fell off him. The hutwas full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleepon the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on thewindow, a newspaper held in its beak.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a largeballoon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window andjerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on topof Hagrid, who didn&#8217;t wake up. The owl then fluttered ontothe floor and began to attack Hagrid&#8217;s coat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped itsbeak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.
