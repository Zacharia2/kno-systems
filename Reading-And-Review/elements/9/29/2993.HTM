<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Could you write it down?&#8221; Harry suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nah &#8212; can&#8217;t spell it. All right &#8212;<I class=calibre9>Voldemort.</I>&#8221; Hagrid shuddered. &#8220;Don&#8217; makeme say it again. Anyway, this &#8212; this wizard, about twentyyears ago now, started lookin&#8217; fer followers. Got &#8217;em,too &#8212; some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o&#8217; hispower, &#8217;cause he was gettin&#8217; himself power, all right.Dark days, Harry. Didn&#8217;t know who ter trust, didn&#8217;tdare get friendly with strange wizards orwitches&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. terrible things happened. He wastakin&#8217; over. &#8217;Course, some stood up to him &#8212;an&#8217; he killed &#8217;em. Horribly. One o&#8217; the only safeplaces left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore&#8217;s the only oneYou-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn&#8217;t dare try takin&#8217; theschool, not jus&#8217; then, anyway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, yer mum an&#8217; dad were as good a witch an&#8217;wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an&#8217; girl at Hogwarts in theirday! Suppose the myst&#8217;ry is why You-Know-Who never tried toget &#8217;em on his side before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. probably knewthey were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin&#8217; ter dowith the Dark Side.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Maybe he thought he could persuade&#8217;em&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe he just wanted &#8217;em outtathe way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where youwas all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a yearold. He came ter yer house an&#8217;&#8212; an&#8217;&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchiefand blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s that sad&#8212; knew yer mum an&#8217; dad, an&#8217; nicer people yehcouldn&#8217;t find &#8212; anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You-Know-Who killed &#8217;em. An&#8217; then &#8212;an&#8217; this is the real myst&#8217;ry of the thing &#8212; hetried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, Isuppose, or maybe he just liked killin&#8217; by then. But hecouldn&#8217;t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yerforehead? That was no ordinary cut. That&#8217;s what yeh get whena powerful, evil curse touches yeh &#8212; took care of yer muman&#8217; dad an&#8217; yer house, even &#8212; but it didn&#8217;twork on you, an&#8217; that&#8217;s why yer famous, Harry. No oneever lived after he decided ter kill &#8217;em, no one except you,an&#8217; he&#8217;d killed some o&#8217; the best witchesan&#8217; wizards of the age &#8212; the McKinnons, the Bones, thePrewetts &#8212; an&#8217; you was only a baby, an&#8217; youlived.&#8221;
