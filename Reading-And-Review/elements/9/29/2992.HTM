<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Then she met that Potter at school and they left and gotmarried and had you, and of course I knew you&#8217;d be just thesame, just as strange, just as &#8212; as &#8212; <I class=calibre9>abnormal</I>&#8212; and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown upand we got landed with you!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice hesaid, &#8220;Blown up? You told me they died in a carcrash!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;CAR CRASH!&#8221; roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrilythat the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. &#8220;How could acar crash kill Lily an&#8217; James Potter? It&#8217;s an outrage!A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin&#8217; his own story when everykid in our world knows his name!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But why? What happened?&#8221; Harry asked urgently.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The anger faded from Hagrid&#8217;s face. He looked suddenlyanxious.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I never expected this,&#8221; he said, in a low, worriedvoice. &#8220;I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might betrouble gettin&#8217; hold of yeh, how much yeh didn&#8217;t know.Ah, Harry, I don&#8217; know if I&#8217;m the right person ter tellyeh &#8212; but someone&#8217;s gotta &#8212; yeh can&#8217;t gooff ter Hogwarts not knowin&#8217;.&#8221;</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and thensaid, &#8220;It begins, I suppose, with &#8212; with a personcalled &#8212; but it&#8217;s incredible yeh don&#8217;t know hisname, everyone in our world knows &#8212;&#8221;</P>
