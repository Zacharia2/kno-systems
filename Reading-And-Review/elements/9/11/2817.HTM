<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; said Ron, but Harry,sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn&#8217;tanswer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; histrousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas intoa large bowl.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; he said, smiling. &#8220;Finished yerexams? Got time fer a drink?&#8221;</P>
