<strong><font color="blue">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone : </font></strong>

<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Maybe it was because they hadn&#8217;t seen what Harry had seenin the forest, or because they didn&#8217;t have scars burning ontheir foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn&#8217;t seem as worriedabout the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scaredthem, but he didn&#8217;t keep visiting them in dreams, and theywere so busy with their studying they didn&#8217;t have much timeto fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answeringquestions about batty old wizards who&#8217;d inventedself-stirring cauldrons and they&#8217;d be free, free for a wholewonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost ofProfessor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll uptheir parchment, Harry couldn&#8217;t help cheering with therest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That was far easier than I thought it would be,&#8221;said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunnygrounds. &#8220;I needn&#8217;t have learned about the 1637Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric theEager.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward,but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to thelake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordanwere tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking inthe warm shallows.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No more studying,&#8221; Ron sighed happily, stretchingout on the grass. &#8220;You could look more cheerful, Harry,we&#8217;ve got a week before we find out how badly we&#8217;vedone, there&#8217;s no need to worry yet.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was rubbing his forehead.
