<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But who&#8217;d be that desperate?&#8221; he wonderedaloud. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to be cursed forever,death&#8217;s better, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It is,&#8221; Firenze agreed, &#8220;unless all you needis to stay alive long enough to drink something else &#8212;something that will bring you back to full strength and power&#8212; something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, doyou know what is hidden in the school at this verymoment?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone! Of course &#8212; the Elixirof Life! But I don&#8217;t understand who &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can you think of nobody who has waited many years toreturn to power, who has clung to life, awaiting theirchance?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly aroundHarry&#8217;s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed tohear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met:&#8220;Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he hadenough human left in him to die.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; Harry croaked, &#8220;that was<I class=calibre9>Vol</I> &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry! Harry, are you all right?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffingalong behind her.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; said Harry, hardly knowing what hewas saying. &#8220;The unicorn&#8217;s dead, Hagrid, it&#8217;s inthat clearing back there.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is where I leave you,&#8221; Firenze murmured asHagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. &#8220;You are safenow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry slid off his back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good luck, Harry Potter,&#8221; said Firenze. &#8220;Theplanets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hopethis is one of those times.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest,leaving Harry shivering behind him.
