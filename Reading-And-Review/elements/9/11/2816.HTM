<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I wish I knew what this <I class=calibre9>means</I>!&#8221; he burst outangrily. &#8220;My scar keeps hurting &#8212; it&#8217;s happenedbefore, but never as often as this.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to Madam Pomfrey,&#8221; Hermione suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not ill,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I thinkit&#8217;s a warning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it means danger&#8217;scoming.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron couldn&#8217;t get worked up, it was too hot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry, relax, Hermione&#8217;s right, the Stone&#8217;ssafe as long as Dumbledore&#8217;s around. Anyway, we&#8217;venever had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. Henearly had his leg ripped off once, he&#8217;s not going to try itagain in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for Englandbefore Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry nodded, but he couldn&#8217;t shake off a lurking feelingthat there was something he&#8217;d forgotten to do, somethingimportant. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said,&#8220;That&#8217;s just the exams. I woke up last night and washalfway through my Transfiguration notes before I rememberedwe&#8217;d done that one.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn&#8217;t haveanything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter towardthe school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth.Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid wouldnever betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to getpast Fluffy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but&#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where&#8217;re you going?&#8221; said Ron sleepily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just thought of something,&#8221; said Harry.He had turned white. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go and see Hagrid,now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why?&#8221; panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a bit odd,&#8221; saidHarry, scrambling up the grassy slope, &#8220;that what Hagridwants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns upwho just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many peoplewander around with dragon eggs if it&#8217;s against wizard law?Lucky they found Hagrid, don&#8217;t you think? Why didn&#8217;t Isee it before?&#8221;
