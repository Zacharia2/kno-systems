<P></P>
<P class=break>Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room,waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditchfouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds,though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermionewhat had happened in the forest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t sit down. He paced up and down in front ofthe fire. He was still shaking.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.and Voldemort&#8217;s waiting in the forest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to getrich.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stop saying the name!&#8221; said Ron in a terrifiedwhisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry wasn&#8217;t listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Firenze saved me, but he shouldn&#8217;t have doneso.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bane was furious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hewas talking about interfering with what the planets say is going tohappen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They must show that Voldemort&#8217;scoming back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bane thinks Firenze should havelet Voldemort kill me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose that&#8217;swritten in the stars as well.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Will you stop saying the name!&#8221;</I> Ronhissed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So all I&#8217;ve got to wait for now is Snape to stealthe Stone,&#8221; Harry went on feverishly, &#8220;then Voldemortwill be able to come and finish me off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well,I suppose Bane&#8217;ll be happy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word ofcomfort.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry, everyone says Dumbledore&#8217;s the only oneYou-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around,You-Know-Who won&#8217;t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaursare right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and ProfessorMcGonagall says that&#8217;s a very imprecise branch ofmagic.&#8221;
