<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you not see that unicorn?&#8221; Firenze bellowed atBane. &#8220;Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have theplanets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what islurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if Imust.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best hecould, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Banebehind them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why&#8217;s Bane so angry?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Whatwas that thing you saved me from, anyway?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed incase of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry&#8217;squestion. They made their way through the trees in silence for solong that Harry thought Firenze didn&#8217;t want to talk to himanymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch oftrees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is usedfor?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harry, startled by the odd question.&#8220;We&#8217;ve only used the horn and tail hair inPotions.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay aunicorn,&#8221; said Firenze. &#8220;Only one who has nothing tolose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The bloodof a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch fromdeath, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure anddefenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, acursed life, from the moment the blood touches yourlips.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared at the back of Firenze&#8217;s head, which wasdappled silver in the moonlight.
