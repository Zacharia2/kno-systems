<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,&#8221; shesaid coldly. &#8220;He received an urgent owl from the Ministry ofMagic and flew off for London at once.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>gone</I>?&#8221; said Harry frantically.<I class=calibre9>&#8220;Now?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, hehas many demands on his time &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But this is important.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Something you have to say is more important than theMinistry of Magic, Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Harry, throwing caution to the winds,&#8220;Professor &#8212; it&#8217;s about the Sorcerer&#8217;sStone &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn&#8217;tthat. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but shedidn&#8217;t pick them up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How do you know &#8212; ?&#8221; she spluttered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor, I think &#8212; I <I class=calibre9>know</I> &#8212; that Sn&#8212; that someone&#8217;s going to try and steal the Stone.I&#8217;ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,&#8221; shesaid finally. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you found out about theStone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it&#8217;stoo well protected.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Professor &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, I know what I&#8217;m talking about,&#8221; shesaid shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books.&#8220;I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy thesunshine.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But they didn&#8217;t.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s tonight,&#8221; said Harry, once he was sureProfessor McGonagall was out of earshot. &#8220;Snape&#8217;s goingthrough the trapdoor tonight. He&#8217;s found out everything heneeds, and now he&#8217;s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sentthat note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock whenDumbledore turns up.&#8221;
