<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He&#8217;d never felt anything like that.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goalposts &#8212; he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out &#8212; and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn&#8217;t turn it. He couldn&#8217;t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Lee was still commentating.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Slytherin in possession &#8212; Flint with the Quaffle &#8212; passes Spinnet &#8212; passes Bell &#8212; hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose &#8212; only joking, Professor &#8212; Slytherins score &#8212; oh no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry&#8217;s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dunno what Harry thinks he&#8217;s doing,&#8221; Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. &#8220;If I didn&#8217; know better, I&#8217;d say he&#8217;d lost control of his broom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he can&#8217;t have.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry&#8217;s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.
