<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, Hagrid, the last tree &#8212; put it in the far corner, would you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How many days you got left until yer holidays?&#8221; Hagrid asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just one,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;And that reminds me &#8212; Harry, Ron, we&#8217;ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh yeah, you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The library?&#8221; said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. &#8220;Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren&#8217;t yeh?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not working,&#8221; Harry told him brightly. &#8220;Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we&#8217;ve been trying to find out who he is.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You what?&#8221; Hagrid looked shocked. &#8220;Listen here &#8212; I&#8217;ve told yeh &#8212; drop it. It&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to you what that dog&#8217;s guardin&#8217;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Unless you&#8217;d like to tell us and save us the trouble?&#8221; Harry added. &#8220;We must&#8217;ve been through hundreds of books already and we can&#8217;t find him anywhere &#8212; just give us a hint &#8212; I know I&#8217;ve read his name somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said Hagrid flatly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just have to find out for ourselves, then,&#8221; said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>They had indeed been searching books for Flamel&#8217;s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn&#8217;t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
