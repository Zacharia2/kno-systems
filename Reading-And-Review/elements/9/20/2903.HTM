<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Out! OUT!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him intothe hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their armsover their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They couldhear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off thewalls and floor.</P>
<P id=HP01CH03M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That does it,&#8221; said UncleVernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of hismustache at the same time. &#8220;I want you all back here in fiveminutes ready to leave. We&#8217;re going away. Just pack someclothes. No arguments!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that noone dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their waythrough the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding towardthe highway.

He was hungry, he&#8217;d missed five television programshe&#8217;d wanted to see, and he&#8217;d never gone so long withoutblowing up an alien on his computer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel onthe outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room withtwin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayedawake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights ofpassing cars and wondering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
