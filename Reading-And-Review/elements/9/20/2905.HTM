<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape&#8217;s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I do feel so sorry,&#8221; said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, &#8220;for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they&#8217;re not wanted at home.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he&#8217;d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was true that Harry wasn&#8217;t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn&#8217;t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he&#8217;d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.
