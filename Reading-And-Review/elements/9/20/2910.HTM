<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Merry Christmas,&#8221; said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You, too,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Will you look at this? I&#8217;ve got some presents!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What did you expect, turnips?&#8221; said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry&#8217;s.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it &#8212; it sounded a bit like an owl.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A second, very small parcel contained a note.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s friendly,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Weird!&#8221; he said, &#8220;What a shape! This is money?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can keep it,&#8221; said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. &#8220;Hagrid and my aunt and uncle &#8212; so who sent these?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think I know who that one&#8217;s from,&#8221; said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. &#8220;My mum. I told her you didn&#8217;t expect any presents and &#8212; oh, no,&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;she&#8217;s made you a Weasley sweater.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Every year she makes us a sweater,&#8221; said Ron, unwrapping his own, &#8220;and mine&#8217;s always maroon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s really nice of her,&#8221; said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His next present also contained candy &#8212; a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.
