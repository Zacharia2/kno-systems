<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn&#8217;t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he&#8217;d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you looking for, boy?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;d better get out, then. Go on &#8212; out!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wishing he&#8217;d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they&#8217;d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she&#8217;d be able to tell them, but they couldn&#8217;t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn&#8217;t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn&#8217;t surprising they&#8217;d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You will keep looking while I&#8217;m away, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;And send me an owl if you find anything.&#8221;
