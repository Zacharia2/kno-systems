<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I found out something about him,&#8221; he told Hagrid. &#8220;He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it&#8217;s guarding.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid dropped the teapot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How do you know about Fluffy?&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Fluffy?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; he&#8217;s mine &#8212; bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las&#8217; year &#8212; I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Harry eagerly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t ask me anymore,&#8221; said Hagrid gruffly. &#8220;That&#8217;s top secret, that is.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Snape&#8217;s trying to <I class=calibre9>steal</I> it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; said Hagrid again. &#8220;Snape&#8217;s a Hogwarts teacher, he&#8217;d do nothin&#8217; of the sort.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So why did he just try and kill Harry?&#8221; cried Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The afternoon&#8217;s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I&#8217;ve read all about them! You&#8217;ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn&#8217;t blinking at all, I saw him!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; yeh, yer wrong!&#8221; said Hagrid hotly. &#8220;I don&#8217; know why Harry&#8217;s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn&#8217; try an&#8217; kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh &#8212; yer meddlin&#8217; in things that don&#8217; concern yeh. It&#8217;s dangerous. You forget that dog, an&#8217; you forget what it&#8217;s guardin&#8217;, that&#8217;s between Professor Dumbledore an&#8217; Nicolas Flamel &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;so there&#8217;s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked furious with himself.</P>

<P class=first>Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.
