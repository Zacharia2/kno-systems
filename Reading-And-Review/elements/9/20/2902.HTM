<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?&#8221; Seamus whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t have,&#8221; Hagrid said, his voice shaking. &#8220;Can&#8217;t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic &#8212; no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid&#8217;s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; moaned Ron, gray-faced.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; Hermione gasped, &#8220;Snape &#8212; look.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s doing something &#8212; jinxing the broom,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What should we do?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Leave it to me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good &#8212; every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on, Hermione,&#8221; Ron muttered desperately.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn&#8217;t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape&#8217;s robes.
