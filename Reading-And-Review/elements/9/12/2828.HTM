<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad we know what it&#8217;s called,that&#8217;s a great help,&#8221; snarled Ron, leaning back, tryingto stop the plant from curling around his neck.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up, I&#8217;m trying to remember how to killit!&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, hurry up, I can&#8217;t breathe!&#8221; Harrygasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Devil&#8217;s Snare, Devil&#8217;sSnare&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what did Professor Sprout say? &#8212;it likes the dark and the damp &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So light a fire!&#8221; Harry choked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes &#8212; of course &#8212; but there&#8217;s nowood!&#8221; Hermione cried, wringing her hands.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;HAVE YOU GONE MAD?&#8221; Ron bellowed. &#8220;ARE YOU AWITCH OR NOT?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, right!&#8221; said Hermione, and she whipped out herwand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the samebluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter ofseconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed awayfrom the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveleditself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,&#8221;said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off hisface.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Ron, &#8220;and lucky Harrydoesn&#8217;t lose his head in a crisis &#8212;&#8216;there&#8217;sno wood,&#8217; <I class=calibre9>honestly.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This way,&#8221; said Harry, pointing down a stonepassageway, which was the only way forward.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentledrip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway slopeddownward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasantjolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guardingvaults in the wizards&#8217; bank. If they met a dragon, afully-grown dragon &#8212; Norbert had been badenough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
