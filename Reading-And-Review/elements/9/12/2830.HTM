<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But there are <I class=calibre9>hundreds</I> of them!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron examined the lock on the door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for a big, old-fashioned one &#8212;probably silver, like the handle.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH16M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>They each seized a broomstick andkicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud ofkeys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted anddived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in acentury. He had a knack for spotting things other peopledidn&#8217;t. After a minute&#8217;s weaving about through thewhirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had abent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughlyinto the keyhole.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That one!&#8221; he called to the others. &#8220;That bigone &#8212; there &#8212; no, there &#8212; with bright blue wings&#8212; the feathers are all crumpled on one side.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing,crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to close in on it!&#8221; Harry called,not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. &#8220;Ron,you come at it from above &#8212; Hermione, stay below and stop itfrom going down &#8212; and I&#8217;ll try and catch it. Right,NOW!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both,and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leanedforward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against thestone with one hand. Ron and Hermione&#8217;s cheers echoed aroundthe high chamber.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the keystruggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned&#8212; it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the keytook flight again, looking very battered now that it had beencaught twice.
