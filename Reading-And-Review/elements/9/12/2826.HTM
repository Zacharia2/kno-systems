<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Looks like a harp,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Snape musthave left it there.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It must wake up the moment you stop playing,&#8221; saidHarry. &#8220;Well, here goes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He put Hagrid&#8217;s flute to his lips and blew. Itwasn&#8217;t really a tune, but from the first note thebeast&#8217;s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.Slowly, the dog&#8217;s growls ceased &#8212; it tottered on itspaws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fastasleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Keep playing,&#8221; Ron warned Harry as they slipped outof the Cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel thedog&#8217;s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giantheads.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be able to pull the door open,&#8221;said Ron, peering over the dog&#8217;s back. &#8220;Want to gofirst, Hermione?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right.&#8221; Ron gritted his teeth and steppedcarefully over the dog&#8217;s legs. He bent and pulled the ring ofthe trapdoor, which swung up and open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What can you see?&#8221; Hermione said anxiously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing &#8212; just black &#8212; there&#8217;s no wayof climbing down, we&#8217;ll just have to drop.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get hisattention and pointed at himself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You want to go first? Are you sure?&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how deep this thing goes. Give the fluteto Hermione so she can keep him asleep.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds&#8217; silence,the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began toplay, it fell back into its deep sleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor.There was no sign of the bottom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on byhis fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, &#8220;Ifanything happens to me, don&#8217;t follow. Go straight to theowlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?&#8221;
