<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He glared at them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Harry,&#8221; said Hermione in asmall voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll use the Invisibility Cloak,&#8221; said Harry.&#8220;It&#8217;s just lucky I got it back.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But will it cover all three of us?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All &#8212; all three of us?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, come off it, you don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d let yougo alone?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Hermione briskly. &#8220;Howdo you think you&#8217;d get to the Stone without us? I&#8217;dbetter go and look through my books, there might be somethinguseful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But if we get caught, you two will be expelled,too.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not if I can help it,&#8221; said Hermione grimly.&#8220;Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelvepercent on his exam. They&#8217;re not throwing me out afterthat.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>After dinner the three of them sat nervously apartin the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindorshad anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was thefirst night he hadn&#8217;t been upset by it. Hermione was skimmingthrough all her notes, hoping to come across one of theenchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Rondidn&#8217;t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what theywere about to do.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better get the Cloak,&#8221; Ron muttered, as Lee Jordanfinally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to theirdark dormitory. He pulled out the Cloak and then his eyes fell onthe flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to useon Fluffy &#8212; he didn&#8217;t feel much like singing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He ran back down to the common room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;d better put the Cloak on here, and make sure itcovers all three of us &#8212; if Filch spots one of our feetwandering along on its own &#8212;&#8221;
