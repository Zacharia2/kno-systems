<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She raised her wand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Petrificus Totalus!&#8221;</I> she cried, pointing itat Neville.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville&#8217;s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprangtogether. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and thenfell flat on his face, stiff as a board.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville&#8217;s jaws were jammedtogether so he couldn&#8217;t speak. Only his eyes were moving,looking at them in horror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;ve you done to him?&#8221; Harrywhispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s the full Body-Bind,&#8221; said Hermionemiserably. &#8220;Oh, Neville, I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We had to, Neville, no time to explain,&#8221; saidHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ll understand later, Neville,&#8221; said Ronas they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn&#8217;tfeel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, everystatue&#8217;s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath ofwind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norrisskulking near the top.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s kick her, just this once,&#8221; Ronwhispered in Harry&#8217;s ear, but Harry shook his head. As theyclimbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyeson them, but didn&#8217;t do anything.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They didn&#8217;t meet anyone else until they reached thestaircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up,loosening the carpet so that people would trip.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; he said suddenly as theyclimbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. &#8220;Knowyou&#8217;re there, even if I can&#8217;t see you. Are you ghoulieor ghostie or wee student beastie?&#8221;
