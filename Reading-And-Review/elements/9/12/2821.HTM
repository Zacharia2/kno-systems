<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I suppose you think you&#8217;re harder to get past thana pack of enchantments!&#8221; she stormed. &#8220;Enough of thisnonsense! If I hear you&#8217;ve come anywhere near here again,I&#8217;ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley,from my own House!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just said,&#8220;At least Hermione&#8217;s on Snape&#8217;s tail,&#8221; whenthe portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Harry!&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;Snapecame out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting forFlitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I&#8217;ve only just gotaway, I don&#8217;t know where Snape went.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s it then, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Harrysaid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes wereglittering.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out of here tonight and I&#8217;m goingto try and get to the Stone first.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re mad!&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can&#8217;t!&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;After whatMcGonagall and Snape have said? You&#8217;ll beexpelled!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;SO WHAT?&#8221; Harry shouted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t youunderstand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort&#8217;scoming back! Haven&#8217;t you heard what it was like when he wastrying to take over? There won&#8217;t be any Hogwarts to getexpelled from! He&#8217;ll flatten it, or turn it into a school forthe Dark Arts! Losing points doesn&#8217;t matter anymore,can&#8217;t you see? D&#8217;you think he&#8217;ll leave you andyour families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I getcaught before I can get to the Stone, well, I&#8217;ll have to goback to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there,it&#8217;s only dying a bit later than I would have, becauseI&#8217;m never going over to the Dark Side! I&#8217;m goingthrough that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going tostop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?&#8221;
