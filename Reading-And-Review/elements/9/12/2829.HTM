<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can you hear something?&#8221; Ron whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be comingfrom up ahead.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s a ghost?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sounds like wingsto me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s light ahead &#8212; I can see somethingmoving.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH16M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>They reached the end of the passagewayand saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling archinghigh above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds,fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite sideof the chamber was a heavy wooden door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll attack us if we cross theroom?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;They don&#8217;t lookvery vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down atonce&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, there&#8217;s no otherchoice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#8217;ll run.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, andsprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and clawstearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached thedoor untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door,but it wouldn&#8217;t budge, not even when Hermione tried herAlohomora Charm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now what?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;These birds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they can&#8217;t be herejust for decoration,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering &#8212;<I class=calibre9>glittering</I>?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;re not birds!&#8221; Harry said suddenly.&#8220;They&#8217;re <I class=calibre9>keys</I>! Winged keys &#8212; lookcarefully. So that must mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; he lookedaround the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock ofkeys. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes &#8212; look! Broomsticks!We&#8217;ve got to catch the key to the door!&#8221;
