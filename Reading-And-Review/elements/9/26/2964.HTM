<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night&#8217;s surprises weren&#8217;t over.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:</P>

<H2 id=calibre_pb_2 class=calibre12>THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR</H2>
<P class=first>In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox &#8212; points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn&#8217;t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
