<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s sort of secret,&#8221; he said, but he wished at once he hadn&#8217;t, because Professor McGonagall&#8217;s nostrils flared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,&#8221; she said coldly. &#8220;He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone?&#8221; said Harry frantically. &#8220;Now?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But this is important.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, &#8220;Professor &#8212; it&#8217;s about the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn&#8217;t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn&#8217;t pick them up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How do you know &#8212; ?&#8221; she spluttered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor, I think &#8212; I know &#8212; that Sn &#8212; that someone&#8217;s going to try and steal the Stone. I&#8217;ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,&#8221; she said finally. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it&#8217;s too well protected.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Professor &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, I know what I&#8217;m talking about,&#8221; she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. &#8220;I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But they didn&#8217;t.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s tonight,&#8221; said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. &#8220;Snape&#8217;s going through the trapdoor tonight. He&#8217;s found out everything he needs, and now he&#8217;s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.&#8221;
