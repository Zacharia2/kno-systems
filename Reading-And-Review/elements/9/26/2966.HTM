<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I wish I knew what this means!&#8221; he burst out angrily. &#8220;My scar keeps hurting &#8212; it&#8217;s happened before, but never as often as this.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to Madam Pomfrey,&#8221; Hermione suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not ill,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a warning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it means danger&#8217;s coming.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron couldn&#8217;t get worked up, it was too hot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry, relax, Hermione&#8217;s right, the Stone&#8217;s safe as long as Dumbledore&#8217;s around. Anyway, we&#8217;ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he&#8217;s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry nodded, but he couldn&#8217;t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he&#8217;d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, &#8220;That&#8217;s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we&#8217;d done that one.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn&#8217;t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where&#8217;re you going?&#8221; said Ron sleepily.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just thought of something,&#8221; said Harry. He had turned white. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why?&#8221; panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
