<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what can we &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape was standing there.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; he said smoothly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They stared at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be inside on a day like this,&#8221; he said, with an odd, twisted smile.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We were &#8212;&#8221; Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You want to be more careful,&#8221; said Snape. &#8220;Hanging around like this, people will think you&#8217;re up to something. And Gryffindor really can&#8217;t afford to lose any more points, can it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Be warned, Potter &#8212; any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got to do,&#8221; he whispered urgently. &#8220;One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape &#8212; wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you&#8217;d better do that.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.&#8221; He put on a high voice, &#8220;&#8216;Oh Professor Flitwick, I&#8217;m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, shut up,&#8221; said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And we&#8217;d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,&#8221; Harry told Ron. &#8220;Come on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But that part of the plan didn&#8217;t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
