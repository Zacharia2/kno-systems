<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a bit odd,&#8221; said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, &#8220;that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it&#8217;s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don&#8217;t you think? Why didn&#8217;t I see it before?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn&#8217;t answer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; he said, smiling. &#8220;Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, please,&#8221; said Ron, but Harry cut him off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, we&#8217;re in a hurry. Hagrid, I&#8217;ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; said Hagrid casually, &#8220;he wouldn&#8217; take his cloak off.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o&#8217; funny folk in the Hog&#8217;s Head &#8212; that&#8217;s one o&#8217; the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn&#8217; he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mighta come up,&#8221; said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. &#8220;Yeah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he asked what I did, an&#8217; I told him I was gamekeeper here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so I told him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an&#8217; I said what I&#8217;d always really wanted was a dragon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an&#8217; then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&#8217; remember too well, &#8217;cause he kept buyin&#8217; me drinks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let&#8217;s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an&#8217; we could play cards fer it if I wanted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn&#8217; want it ter go ter any old home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
