<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And did he &#8212; did he seem interested in Fluffy?&#8221; Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; yeah &#8212; how many three-headed dogs d&#8217;yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy&#8217;s a piece o&#8217; cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus&#8217; play him a bit o&#8217; music an&#8217; he&#8217;ll go straight off ter sleep &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;ta told yeh that!&#8221; he blurted out. &#8220;Forget I said it! Hey &#8212; where&#8217;re yeh goin&#8217;?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn&#8217;t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go to Dumbledore,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak &#8212; it must&#8217;ve been easy, once he&#8217;d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn&#8217;t stop him. Where&#8217;s Dumbledore&#8217;s office?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to &#8212;&#8221; Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you three doing inside?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We want to see Professor Dumbledore,&#8221; said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See Professor Dumbledore?&#8221; Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry swallowed &#8212; now what?
