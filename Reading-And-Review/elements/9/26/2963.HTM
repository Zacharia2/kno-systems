<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.</P>
<P class=break>Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Voldemort&#8217;s waiting in the forest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stop saying the name!&#8221; said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry wasn&#8217;t listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Firenze saved me, but he shouldn&#8217;t have done so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bane was furious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They must show that Voldemort&#8217;s coming back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose that&#8217;s written in the stars as well.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Will you stop saying the name!&#8221; Ron hissed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So all I&#8217;ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,&#8221; Harry went on feverishly, &#8220;then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I suppose Bane&#8217;ll be happy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry, everyone says Dumbledore&#8217;s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won&#8217;t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that&#8217;s a very imprecise branch of magic.&#8221;
