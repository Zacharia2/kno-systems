<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look &#8212;&#8221; he murmured, holding out his arm tostop Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inchedcloser.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had neverseen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs werestuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spreadpearly-white on the dark leaves.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound madehim freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearingquivered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then, out of the shadows, a hoodedfigure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast.Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figurereached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in theanimal&#8217;s side, and began to drink its blood.</P>
<P id=HP01CH15M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;AAAAAAAAAAARGH!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted &#8212; so did Fang.The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry &#8212;unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet andcame swiftly toward Harry &#8212; he couldn&#8217;t move forfear.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a pain like he&#8217;d never felt before pierced his head;it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggeredbackward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and somethingjumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The pain in Harry&#8217;s head was so bad he fell to his knees.It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure hadgone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this onelooked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; said the centaur, pulling Harryto his feet.
