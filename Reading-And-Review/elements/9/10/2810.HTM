<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes &#8212; thank you &#8212; what <I class=calibre9>was</I>that?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The centaur didn&#8217;t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes,like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyeslingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry&#8217;sforehead.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You are the Potter boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You hadbetter get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time&#8212; especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker thisway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My name is Firenze,&#8221; he added, as he loweredhimself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto hisback.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other sideof the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees,their flanks heaving and sweaty.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Firenze!&#8221; Bane thundered. &#8220;What are youdoing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you acommon mule?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you realize who this is?&#8221; said Firenze.&#8220;This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest,the better.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What have you been telling him?&#8221; growled Bane.&#8220;Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves againstthe heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements ofthe planets?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ronan pawed the ground nervously. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure Firenzethought he was acting for the best,&#8221; he said in his gloomyvoice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Bane kicked his back legs in anger.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs areconcerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business torun around like donkeys after stray humans in ourforest!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so thatHarry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.
