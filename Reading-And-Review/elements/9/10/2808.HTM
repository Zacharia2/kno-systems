<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept lookingnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they werebeing watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbowwith them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermionegrabbed Hagrid&#8217;s arm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are introuble!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You two wait here!&#8221; Hagrid shouted. &#8220;Stay onthe path, I&#8217;ll come back for yeh!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stoodlooking at each other, very scared, until they couldn&#8217;t hearanything but the rustling of leaves around them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve been hurt, doyou?&#8221; whispered Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if Malfoy has, but ifsomething&#8217;s got Neville&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#8217;s ourfault he&#8217;s here in the first place.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual.Harry&#8217;s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, everycracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid&#8217;sreturn. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming.Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him asa joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be lucky ter catch anythin&#8217; now, withthe racket you two were makin&#8217;. Right, we&#8217;rechangin&#8217; groups &#8212; Neville, you stay with me an&#8217;Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an&#8217; this idiot. I&#8217;msorry,&#8221; Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, &#8220;buthe&#8217;ll have a harder time frightenin&#8217; you, an&#8217;we&#8217;ve gotta get this done.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy andFang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper intothe forest, until the path became almost impossible to followbecause the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed tobe getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, asthough the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain closeby. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branchesof an ancient oak.
