<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The forest was black and silent. A little way into it theyreached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagridtook the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took theright.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now andthen a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot ofsilver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Could</I> a werewolf be killing the unicorns?&#8221;Harry asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not fast enough,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;It&#8217;snot easy ter catch a unicorn, they&#8217;re powerful magiccreatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear runningwater; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were stillspots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You all right, Hermione?&#8221; Hagrid whispered.&#8220;Don&#8217; worry, it can&#8217;t&#8217;ve gone far ifit&#8217;s this badly hurt, an&#8217; then we&#8217;ll be able ter&#8212; GET BEHIND THAT TREE!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the pathbehind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it intohis crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of themlistened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: itsounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid wassquinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the soundfaded away.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;There&#8217;ssummat in here that shouldn&#8217; be.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A werewolf?&#8221; Harry suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That wasn&#8217; no werewolf an&#8217; it wasn&#8217; nounicorn, neither,&#8221; said Hagrid grimly. &#8220;Right, followme, but careful, now.&#8221;
