<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve got no <I class=calibre9>proof</I>!&#8221; said Harry.&#8220;Quirrell&#8217;s too scared to back us up. Snape&#8217;sonly got to say he doesn&#8217;t know how the troll got in atHalloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor &#8212; whodo you think they&#8217;ll believe, him or us? It&#8217;s notexactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore&#8217;ll think we made itup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn&#8217;t help us if his lifedepended on it, he&#8217;s too friendly with Snape, and the morestudents get thrown out, the better, he&#8217;ll think. Anddon&#8217;t forget, we&#8217;re not supposed to know about theStone or Fluffy. That&#8217;ll take a lot of explaining.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn&#8217;t.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If we just do a bit of poking around &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harry flatly, &#8220;we&#8217;ve doneenough poking around.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn thenames of its moons.</P>
<P class=break>The following morning, notes were delivered toHarry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were allthe same:</P>

<P class=noindent>Harry had forgotten they still had detentionsto do in the furor over the points they&#8217;d lost. He halfexpected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night ofstudying lost, but she didn&#8217;t say a word. Like Harry, shefelt they deserved what they&#8217;d got.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At eleven o&#8217;clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron inthe common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville.Filch was already there &#8212; and so was Malfoy. Harry had alsoforgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; said Filch, lighting a lamp and leadingthem outside.
