<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I bet you&#8217;ll think twice about breaking a schoolrule again, won&#8217;t you, eh?&#8221; he said, leering at them.&#8220;Oh yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hard work and pain are the bestteachers if you ask me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&#8217;s just a pitythey let the old punishments die out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hang youby your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I&#8217;ve got thechains still in my office, keep &#8217;em well oiled in casethey&#8217;re ever needed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Right, off we go,and don&#8217;t think of running off, now, it&#8217;ll be worse foryou if you do.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing.Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must besomething really horrible, or Filch wouldn&#8217;t be sounding sodelighted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwingthem into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows ofHagrid&#8217;s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter getstarted.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s heart rose; if they were going to be working withHagrid it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. His relief must have showed inhis face, because Filch said, &#8220;I suppose you thinkyou&#8217;ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again,boy &#8212; it&#8217;s into the forest you&#8217;re going andI&#8217;m much mistaken if you&#8217;ll all come out in onepiece.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped deadin his tracks.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The forest?&#8221; he repeated, and he didn&#8217;t soundquite as cool as usual. &#8220;We can&#8217;t go in there at night&#8212; there&#8217;s all sorts of things in there &#8212;werewolves, I heard.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry&#8217;s robe and made achoking noise.
