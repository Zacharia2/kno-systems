<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed &#8212; for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder &#8212; but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror&#8217;s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he&#8217;d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air &#8212; she and the others existed only in the mirror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes &#8212; her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green &#8212; exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry&#8217;s did.
