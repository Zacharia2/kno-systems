<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody&#8217;s been in the library &#8212; Restricted Section.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, &#8220;The Restricted Section? Well, they can&#8217;t be far, we&#8217;ll catch them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn&#8217;t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they&#8217;d knock right into him &#8212; the Cloak didn&#8217;t stop him from being solid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket &#8212; but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn&#8217;t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
