<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of those,&#8221; he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he&#8217;d gotten from Hermione. &#8220;If that&#8217;s what I think it is &#8212; they&#8217;re really rare, and really valuable.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s an Invisibility Cloak,&#8221; said Ron, a look of awe on his face. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it is &#8212; try it on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry threw the Cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It <I class=calibre9>is</I>! Look down!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the Cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s a note!&#8221; said Ron suddenly. &#8220;A note fell out of it!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry pulled off the Cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:</P>
<DIV class=block>
<DIV class=calibre1>
<DIV class=block>
<DIV class=topbot>
<P class=noindent>Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you.</P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Use it well.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>A Very Merry Christmas to you</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the Cloak.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d give anything for one of these,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anything. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the Cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?
