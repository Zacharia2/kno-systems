<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the Cloak quickly out of sight. He didn&#8217;t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Merry Christmas!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hey, look &#8212; Harry&#8217;s got a Weasley sweater, too!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry&#8217;s is better than ours, though,&#8221; said Fred, holding up Harry&#8217;s sweater. &#8220;She obviously makes more of an effort if you&#8217;re not family.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you wearing yours, Ron?&#8221; George demanded. &#8220;Come on, get it on, they&#8217;re lovely and warm.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I hate maroon,&#8221; Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got a letter on yours,&#8221; George observed. &#8220;I suppose she thinks you don&#8217;t forget your name. But we&#8217;re not stupid &#8212; we know we&#8217;re called Gred and Forge.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this noise?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we&#8217;re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I &#8212; don&#8217;t &#8212; want &#8212;&#8221; said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not sitting with the prefects today, either,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Christmas is a time for family.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M02S class=break>Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce &#8212; and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn&#8217;t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral&#8217;s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard&#8217;s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.
