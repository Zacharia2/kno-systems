<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn&#8217;t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;You look odd.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the Cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry&#8217;s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m freezing,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Let&#8217;s forget it and go back.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No!&#8221; Harry hissed. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s here somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s here &#8212; just here &#8212; yes!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the Cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See?&#8221; Harry whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see anything.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look! Look at them all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are loads of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I can only see you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn&#8217;t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look at me!&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can you see all your family standing around you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No &#8212; I&#8217;m alone &#8212; but I&#8217;m different &#8212; I look older &#8212; and I&#8217;m Head Boy!&#8221;
