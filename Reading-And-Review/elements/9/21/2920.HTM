<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;What?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I am &#8212; I&#8217;m wearing the badge like Bill used to &#8212; and I&#8217;m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup &#8212; I&#8217;m Quidditch captain, too!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you think this mirror shows the future?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How can it? All my family are dead &#8212; let me have another look &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what&#8217;s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push me &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn&#8217;t realized how loudly they had been talking.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Quick!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron threw the Cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing &#8212; did the Cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t safe &#8212; she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.</P>
<P class=break>The snow still hadn&#8217;t melted the next morning.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Want to play chess, Harry?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go down and visit Hagrid?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don&#8217;t go back tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I dunno, I&#8217;ve just got a bad feeling about it &#8212; and anyway, you&#8217;ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can&#8217;t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You sound like Hermione.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m serious, Harry, don&#8217;t go.&#8221;
