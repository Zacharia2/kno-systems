<P id=HP01CH12M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry&#8217;s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris&#8217;s Christmas dinner.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn&#8217;t have lost so badly if Percy hadn&#8217;t tried to help him so much.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they&#8217;d stolen his prefect badge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It had been Harry&#8217;s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he&#8217;d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the Cloak out from under it.
