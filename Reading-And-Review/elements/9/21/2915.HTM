<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They didn&#8217;t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn&#8217;t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry&#8217;s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn&#8217;t be.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence &#8212; the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside &#8212; stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch&#8217;s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch&#8217;s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book&#8217;s shrieks still ringing in his ears.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn&#8217;t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn&#8217;t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.
