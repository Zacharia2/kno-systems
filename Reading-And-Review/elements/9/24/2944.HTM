<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When they told him about Charlie&#8217;s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Aargh! It&#8217;s all right, he only got my boot &#8212; jus&#8217; playin&#8217;&#8212; he&#8217;s only a baby, after all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough.</P>
<P class=break>They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn&#8217;t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid&#8217;s hut because they&#8217;d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he&#8217;d been playing tennis against the wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s got lots o&#8217; rats an&#8217; some brandy fer the journey,&#8221; said Hagrid in a muffled voice. &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bye-bye, Norbert!&#8221; Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. &#8220;Mummy will never forget you!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another &#8212; even one of Harry&#8217;s shortcuts didn&#8217;t make the work much easier.
