<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nearly there!&#8221; Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Detention!&#8221; she shouted. &#8220;And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, Professor. Harry Potter&#8217;s coming &#8212; he&#8217;s got a dragon!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on &#8212; I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they&#8217;d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the Cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy&#8217;s got detention! I could sing!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; Harry advised her.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>Charlie&#8217;s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they&#8217;d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last, Norbert was going&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. going&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gone.
