<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No &#8212; no &#8212; not again, please &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right &#8212; all right &#8212;&#8221; he heard Quirrell sob.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn&#8217;t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell&#8217;s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he&#8217;d promised himself about not meddling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All the same, he&#8217;d have gambled twelve Sorcerer&#8217;s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step &#8212; Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he&#8217;d heard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Snape&#8217;s done it, then!&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;If Quirrell&#8217;s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s still Fluffy, though,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Maybe Snape&#8217;s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,&#8221; said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. &#8220;I bet there&#8217;s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron&#8217;s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to Dumbledore. That&#8217;s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we&#8217;ll be thrown out for sure.&#8221;
