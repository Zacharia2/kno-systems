<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just my hand,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;although that feels like it&#8217;s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me &#8212; I&#8217;ve told her it was a dog, but I don&#8217;t think she believes me &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s doing this.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,&#8221; said Hermione, but this didn&#8217;t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Midnight on Saturday!&#8221; he said in a hoarse voice. &#8220;Oh no &#8212; oh no &#8212; I&#8217;ve just remembered &#8212; Charlie&#8217;s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he&#8217;s going to know we&#8217;re getting rid of Norbert.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Hermione didn&#8217;t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.</P>
<P class=break>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late to change the plan now,&#8221; Harry told Hermione. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We&#8217;ll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn&#8217;t know about that.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you in,&#8221; he puffed. &#8220;Norbert&#8217;s at a tricky stage &#8212; nothin&#8217; I can&#8217;t handle.&#8221;
