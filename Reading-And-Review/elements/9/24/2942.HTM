<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It bit me!&#8221; he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon&#8217;s the most horrible animal I&#8217;ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you&#8217;d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a tap on the dark window.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s Hedwig!&#8221; said Harry, hurrying to let her in. &#8220;She&#8217;ll have Charlie&#8217;s answer!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The three of them put their heads together to read the note.</P>

<P class=noindent>Dear Ron,</P>
<P class=noindent>How are you? Thanks for the letter &#8212; I&#8217;d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won&#8217;t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn&#8217;t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it&#8217;s still dark.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&nbsp;Send me an answer as soon as possible.</P>
<DIV class=top1>
<P class=noindent>Love,</P>
<P class=noindent>Charlie</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>They looked at one another.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the Invisibility Cloak,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult &#8212; I think the cloak&#8217;s big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert &#8212; and Malfoy.</P>
<P class=break>There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron&#8217;s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn&#8217;t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey &#8212; would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert&#8217;s fangs were poisonous.
