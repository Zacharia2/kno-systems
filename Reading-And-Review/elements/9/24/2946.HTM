<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon &#8212; Malfoy in detention &#8212; what could spoil their happiness?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch&#8217;s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, well, well,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;we are in trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They&#8217;d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.</P>

<P class=first>Things couldn&#8217;t have been worse.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall&#8217;s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry&#8217;s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn&#8217;t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the Cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Had Harry thought that things couldn&#8217;t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry!&#8221; Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. &#8220;I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag &#8212;&#8221;
