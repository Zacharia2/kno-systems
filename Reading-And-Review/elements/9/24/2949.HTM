<strong><font color="blue">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone : </font></strong>

<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Only Ron stood by him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they&#8217;ve been here, and people still like them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?&#8221; said Harry miserably.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; no,&#8221; Ron admitted.</P>
<P id=HP01CH15M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren&#8217;t his business from now on. He&#8217;d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Resign?&#8221; Wood thundered. &#8220;What good&#8217;ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can&#8217;t win at Quidditch?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn&#8217;t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him &#8220;the Seeker.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn&#8217;t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren&#8217;t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was almost glad that the exams weren&#8217;t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry&#8217;s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn&#8217;t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell&#8217;s voice.
