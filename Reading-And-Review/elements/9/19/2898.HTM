<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He glared at them all as if to say, &#8220;Or else.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right. It&#8217;s time. Good luck, all of you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren&#8217;t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,&#8221; she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mount your brooms, please.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor &#8212; what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;JORDAN!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry, Professor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Weasley twins&#8217; friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And she&#8217;s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood&#8217;s, last year only a reserve &#8212; back to Johnson and &#8212; no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes &#8212; Flint flying like an eagle up there &#8212; he&#8217;s going to sc&#8211; no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle &#8212; that&#8217;s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and &#8212; OUCH &#8212; that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger &#8212; Quaffle taken by the Slytherins &#8212; that&#8217;s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goalposts, but he&#8217;s blocked by a second Bludger &#8212; sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can&#8217;t tell which &#8212; nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes &#8212; she&#8217;s really flying &#8212; dodges a speeding Bludger &#8212; the goalposts are ahead &#8212; come on, now, Angelina &#8212; Keeper Bletchley dives &#8212; misses &#8212; GRYFFINDOR SCORE!&#8221;
