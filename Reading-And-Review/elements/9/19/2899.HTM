<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Budge up there, move along.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bin watchin&#8217; from me hut,&#8221; said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t the same as bein&#8217; in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Harry hasn&#8217;t had much to do yet.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Kept outta trouble, though, that&#8217;s somethin&#8217;,&#8221; said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood&#8217;s game plan.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,&#8221; Wood had said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want you attacked before you have to be.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys&#8217; wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right there, Harry?&#8221; he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Slytherin in possession,&#8221; Lee Jordan was saying, &#8220;Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the &#8212; wait a moment &#8212; was that the Snitch?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.
