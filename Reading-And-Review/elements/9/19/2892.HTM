<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What on earth were you thinking of?&#8221; said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. &#8220;You&#8217;re lucky you weren&#8217;t killed. Why aren&#8217;t you in your dormitory?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a small voice came out of the shadows.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Please, Professor McGonagall &#8212; they were looking for me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Miss Granger!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I went looking for the troll because I &#8212; I thought I could deal with it on my own &#8212; you know, because I&#8217;ve read all about them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t found me, I&#8217;d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn&#8217;t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn&#8217;t new to them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; in that case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, &#8220;Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall. &#8220;I&#8217;m very disappointed in you. If you&#8217;re not hurt at all, you&#8217;d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.&#8221;
