<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn&#8217;t know which was worse &#8212; people telling him he&#8217;d be brilliant or people telling him they&#8217;d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn&#8217;t know how he&#8217;d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry&#8217;s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn&#8217;t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape&#8217;s eye. He limped over. He hadn&#8217;t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.
