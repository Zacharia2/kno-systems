<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve got there, Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was <I class=calibre9>Quidditch Through the Ages.</I> Harry showed him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Library books are not to be taken outside the school,&#8221; said Snape. &#8220;Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s just made that rule up,&#8221; Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. &#8220;Wonder what&#8217;s wrong with his leg?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dunno, but I hope it&#8217;s really hurting him,&#8221; said Ron bitterly.</P>
<P id=HP01CH11M01S class=break>The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron&#8217;s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (&#8220;How will you learn?&#8221;), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better you than me,&#8221; they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn&#8217;t refuse if there were other teachers listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside &#8212; and a horrible scene met his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Blasted thing,&#8221; Snape was saying. &#8220;How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?&#8221;
