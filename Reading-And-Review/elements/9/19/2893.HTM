<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione left.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They hurried out of the chamber and didn&#8217;t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We should have gotten more than ten points,&#8221; Ron grumbled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Five, you mean, once she&#8217;s taken off Hermione&#8217;s.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,&#8221; Ron admitted. &#8220;Mind you, we did save her.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;She might not have needed saving if we hadn&#8217;t locked the thing in with her,&#8221; Harry reminded him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Pig snout,&#8221; they said and entered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; and hurried off to get plates.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can&#8217;t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.</P>

<P class=first>As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
