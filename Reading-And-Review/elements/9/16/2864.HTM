<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. Ontop of the fridge stood tonight&#8217;s pudding: a huge mound ofwhipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork wassizzling in the oven.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!&#8221; snappedAunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheeseon the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pinkcocktail dress.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. Themoment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate.&#8220;Upstairs! Hurry!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpseof Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He hadonly just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang andUncle Vernon&#8217;s furious face appeared at the foot of thestairs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Remember, boy &#8212; one sound &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closedthe door, and turned to collapse on his bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.</P>
