<P id=HP01CH09M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Catch it if you can, then!&#8221; he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down &#8212; next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball &#8212; wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching &#8212; he stretched out his hand &#8212; a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;HARRY POTTER!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His heart sank faster than he&#8217;d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never &#8212; in all my time at Hogwarts &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, &#8220;&#8212; how dare you &#8212; might have broken your neck &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his fault, Professor &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Be quiet, Miss Patil &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Malfoy &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle&#8217;s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall&#8217;s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he&#8217;d done it. He hadn&#8217;t even lasted two weeks. He&#8217;d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?
