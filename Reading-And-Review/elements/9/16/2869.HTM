<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry nodded silently. He didn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on, but he didn&#8217;t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,&#8221; Professor McGonagall told Wood. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn&#8217;t have done it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?&#8221; he asked excitedly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wood&#8217;s captain of the Gryffindor team,&#8221; Professor McGonagall explained.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s just the build for a Seeker, too,&#8221; said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. &#8220;Light &#8212; speedy &#8212; we&#8217;ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor &#8212; a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I&#8217;d say.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can&#8217;t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn&#8217;t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want to hear you&#8217;re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then she suddenly smiled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Your father would have been proud,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>&#8220;You&#8217;re <I class=calibre9>joking.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he&#8217;d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he&#8217;d forgotten all about it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Seeker?&#8221; he said. &#8220;But first years never &#8212; you must be the youngest House player in about &#8212;&#8221;
