<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why&#8217;re you staring at the hedge?&#8221; he saidsuspiciously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to decide what would be the best spellto set it on fire,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fatface.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You c-can&#8217;t &#8212; Dad told you you&#8217;re notto do m-magic &#8212; he said he&#8217;ll chuck you out of thehouse &#8212; and you haven&#8217;t got anywhere else to go &#8212;you haven&#8217;t got any <I class=calibre9>friends</I> to take you&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Jiggery pokery!&#8221;</I> said Harry in a fiercevoice. <I class=calibre9>&#8220;Hocus pocus &#8212; squiggly wiggly&#8212;&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;MUUUUUUM!&#8221; howled Dudley, tripping over his feet ashe dashed back toward the house. &#8220;MUUUUM! He&#8217;s doingyou know what!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley northe hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn&#8217;treally done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavyblow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him workto do, with the promise he wouldn&#8217;t eat again untilhe&#8217;d finished.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harrycleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed theflower beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the gardenbench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harryknew he shouldn&#8217;t have risen to Dudley&#8217;s bait, butDudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinkinghimself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe he <I class=calibre9>didn&#8217;t</I> have anyfriends at Hogwarts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now,</I> he thoughtsavagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching,sweat running down his face.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted,he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.
