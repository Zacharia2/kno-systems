<P class=epubfirstparagraph>What wouldn&#8217;t he give now for a message from Hogwarts?From any witch or wizard? He&#8217;d almost be glad of a sight ofhis archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn&#8217;t allbeen a dream.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the veryend of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other thanLord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his formerself, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determinedto regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort&#8217;sclutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, andeven now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched incold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering hislivid face, his wide, mad eyes &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had beenstaring absent-mindedly into the hedge &#8212; <I class=calibre9>and the hedge wasstaring back.</I> Two enormous green eyes had appeared among theleaves.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated acrossthe lawn.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know what day it is,&#8221; sang Dudley, waddlingtoward him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The huge eyes blinked and vanished.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spotwhere they had been.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know what day it is,&#8221; Dudley repeated, comingright up to him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;So you&#8217;vefinally learned the days of the week.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Today&#8217;s your <I class=calibre9>birthday</I>,&#8221; sneeredDudley. &#8220;How come you haven&#8217;t got any cards?Haven&#8217;t you even got friends at that freak place?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better not let your mum hear you talking about myschool,&#8221; said Harry coolly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fatbottom.
