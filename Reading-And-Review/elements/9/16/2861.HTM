<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right &#8212; I&#8217;m off into town to pick up thedinner jackets for Dudley and me. And <I class=calibre9>you</I>,&#8221; he snarledat Harry. &#8220;You stay out of your aunt&#8217;s way whileshe&#8217;s cleaning.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day.He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sangunder his breath:</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Happy birthday to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. happy birthdayto me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the eveningpretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He hadnever felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, moreeven than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, RonWeasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn&#8217;t seem tobe missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him allsummer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to comeand stay.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlockingHedwig&#8217;s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermionewith a letter, but it wasn&#8217;t worth the risk. Underage wizardsweren&#8217;t allowed to use magic outside of school. Harryhadn&#8217;t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only theirterror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stoppedthem from locking <I class=calibre9>him</I> in the cupboard under the stairs withhis wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harryhad enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watchingDudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carryhim. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feelso cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley hadlost its appeal &#8212; and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten hisbirthday.
