<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn&#8217;t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid&#8217;s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid&#8217;s bag.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick&#8217;s class looking confused.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Follow me, you two,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;In here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Out, Peeves!&#8221; she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood &#8212; I&#8217;ve found you a Seeker.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood&#8217;s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you serious, Professor?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall crisply. &#8220;The boy&#8217;s a natural. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?&#8221;
