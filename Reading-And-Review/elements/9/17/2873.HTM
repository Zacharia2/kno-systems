<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now what am I going to do?&#8221; she asked shrilly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s your problem,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go, we&#8217;re going to be late.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They hadn&#8217;t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming with you,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You are <I class=calibre9>not.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;D&#8217;you think I&#8217;m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I&#8217;ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got some nerve &#8212;&#8221; said Ron loudly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up, both of you!&#8221; said Harry sharply. &#8220;I heard something.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a sort of snuffling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mrs. Norris?&#8221; breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It wasn&#8217;t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thank goodness you found me! I&#8217;ve been out here for hours, I couldn&#8217;t remember the new password to get in to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Keep your voice down, Neville. The password&#8217;s &#8216;Pig snout&#8217; but it won&#8217;t help you now, the Fat Lady&#8217;s gone off somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How&#8217;s your arm?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Neville, showing them. &#8220;Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good &#8212; well, look, Neville, we&#8217;ve got to be somewhere, we&#8217;ll see you later &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me!&#8221; said Neville, scrambling to his feet, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron&#8217;s been past twice already.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If either of you get us caught, I&#8217;ll never rest until I&#8217;ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.&#8221;
