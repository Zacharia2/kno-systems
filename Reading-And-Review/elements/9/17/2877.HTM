<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They weren&#8217;t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren&#8217;t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry groped for the doorknob &#8212; between Filch and death, he&#8217;d take Filch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They fell backward &#8212; Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn&#8217;t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared &#8212; all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn&#8217;t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where on earth have you all been?&#8221; she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never mind that &#8212; pig snout, pig snout,&#8221; panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
