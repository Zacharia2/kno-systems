<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Half-past eleven,&#8221; Ron muttered at last, &#8220;we&#8217;d better go.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re going to do this, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You!&#8221; said Ron furiously. &#8220;Go back to bed!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I almost told your brother,&#8221; Hermione snapped, &#8220;Percy &#8212; he&#8217;s a prefect, he&#8217;d put a stop to this.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t believe anyone could be so interfering.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione wasn&#8217;t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don&#8217;t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you&#8217;ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go away.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you&#8217;re on the train home tomorrow, you&#8217;re so &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But what they were, they didn&#8217;t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
