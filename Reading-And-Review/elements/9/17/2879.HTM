<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s either really valuable or really dangerous,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Or both,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn&#8217;t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone&#8217;s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:</P>

<P class=noindent>DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.</P>
<P class=noindent>It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don&#8217;t want everybody knowing you&#8217;ve got a broomstick or they&#8217;ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o&#8217;clock for your first training session.</P>

<P class=noindent>Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.
