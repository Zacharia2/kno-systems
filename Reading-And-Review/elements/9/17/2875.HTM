<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;RUN!&#8221; Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following &#8212; they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going &#8212; they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve lost him,&#8221; Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I &#8212; told &#8212; you,&#8221; Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, &#8220;I &#8212; told &#8212; you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,&#8221; said Ron, &#8220;quickly as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy tricked you,&#8221; Hermione said to Harry. &#8220;You realize that, don&#8217;t you? He was never going to meet you &#8212; Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn&#8217;t going to tell her that.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It wasn&#8217;t going to be that simple. They hadn&#8217;t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up, Peeves &#8212; please &#8212; you&#8217;ll get us thrown out.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Peeves cackled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you&#8217;ll get caughty.&#8221;
