<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy and Crabbe weren&#8217;t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s late, maybe he&#8217;s chickened out,&#8221; Ron whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak &#8212; and it wasn&#8217;t Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch&#8217;s voice. Neville&#8217;s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;re in here somewhere,&#8221; they heard him mutter, &#8220;probably hiding.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This way!&#8221; Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run &#8212; he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.
