<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he&#8217;d never speak again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What do they think they&#8217;re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?&#8221; said Ron finally. &#8220;If any dog needs exercise, that one does.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t use your eyes, any of you, do you?&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see what it was standing on?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The floor?&#8221; Harry suggested. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It&#8217;s obviously guarding something.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She stood up, glaring at them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed &#8212; or worse, expelled. Now, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron stared after her, his mouth open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, we don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;d think we dragged her along, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide &#8212; except perhaps Hogwarts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.</P>

<P class=first>Malfoy couldn&#8217;t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
