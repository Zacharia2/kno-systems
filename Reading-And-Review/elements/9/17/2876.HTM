<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not if you don&#8217;t give us away, Peeves, please.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Should tell Filch, I should,&#8221; said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s for your own good, you know.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get out of the way,&#8221; snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves &#8212; this was a big mistake.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;STUDENTS OUT OF BED!&#8221; Peeves bellowed, &#8220;STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door &#8212; and it was locked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is it!&#8221; Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, &#8220;We&#8217;re done for! This is the end!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves&#8217;s shouts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, move over,&#8221; Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry&#8217;s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, &#8220;Alohomora!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The lock clicked and the door swung open &#8212; they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Which way did they go, Peeves?&#8221; Filch was saying. &#8220;Quick, tell me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Say &#8216;please.&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t say nothing if you don&#8217;t say please,&#8221; said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right &#8212; <I class=calibre9>please.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn&#8217;t say nothing if you didn&#8217;t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!&#8221; And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He thinks this door is locked,&#8221; Harry whispered. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be okay &#8212; get off, Neville!&#8221; For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry&#8217;s bathrobe for the last minute. &#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry turned around &#8212; and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he&#8217;d walked into a nightmare &#8212; this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
