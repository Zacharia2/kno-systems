<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Should call Filch, I should, if something&#8217;s a-creeping around unseen.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had a sudden idea.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Peeves,&#8221; he said, in a hoarse whisper, &#8220;the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,&#8221; he said greasily. &#8220;My mistake, my mistake &#8212; I didn&#8217;t see you &#8212; of course I didn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re invisible &#8212; forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I have business here, Peeves,&#8221; croaked Harry. &#8220;Stay away from this place tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I will, sir, I most certainly will,&#8221; said Peeves, rising up in the air again. &#8220;Hope your business goes well, Baron, I&#8217;ll not bother you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And he scooted off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Brilliant,</I> Harry!&#8221; whispered Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor &#8212; and the door was already ajar.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, there you are,&#8221; Harry said quietly, &#8220;Snape&#8217;s already got past Fluffy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the Cloak, Harry turned to the other two.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If you want to go back, I won&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can take the Cloak, I won&#8217;t need it now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;re coming,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry pushed the door open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog&#8217;s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn&#8217;t see them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s that at its feet?&#8221; Hermione whispered.
