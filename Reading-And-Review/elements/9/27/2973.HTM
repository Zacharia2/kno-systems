<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he&#8217;d been making another bid for freedom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing, Neville, nothing,&#8221; said Harry, hurriedly putting the Cloak behind his back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville stared at their guilty faces.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re going out again,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;No, we&#8217;re not. Why don&#8217;t you go to bed, Neville?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn&#8217;t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go out,&#8221; said Neville, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;this is important.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you do it,&#8221; he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. &#8220;I&#8217;ll &#8212; I&#8217;ll fight you!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Neville,&#8221; Ron exploded, &#8220;get away from that hole and don&#8217;t be an idiot &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you call me an idiot!&#8221; said Neville. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, but not to us,&#8221; said Ron in exasperation. &#8220;Neville, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go on then, try and hit me!&#8221; said Neville, raising his fists. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry turned to Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Do something,&#8221;</I> he said desperately.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione stepped forward.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Neville,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m really, really sorry about this.&#8221;
