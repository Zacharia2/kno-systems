<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See you in a minute, I hope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay!&#8221; he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, &#8220;it&#8217;s a soft landing, you can jump!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s this stuff?&#8221; were his first words.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it&#8217;s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry&#8217;s other side.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We must be miles under the school,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Lucky this plant thing&#8217;s here, really,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Lucky!&#8221; shrieked Hermione. &#8220;Look at you both!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stop moving!&#8221; Hermione ordered them. &#8220;I know what this is &#8212; it&#8217;s Devil&#8217;s Snare!&#8221;
