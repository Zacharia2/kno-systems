<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He glared at them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Harry,&#8221; said Hermione in a small voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll use the Invisibility Cloak,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;It&#8217;s just lucky I got it back.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But will it cover all three of us?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All &#8212; all three of us?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, come off it, you don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d let you go alone?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Hermione briskly. &#8220;How do you think you&#8217;d get to the Stone without us? I&#8217;d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not if I can help it,&#8221; said Hermione grimly. &#8220;Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They&#8217;re not throwing me out after that.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn&#8217;t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn&#8217;t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better get the Cloak,&#8221; Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the Cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy &#8212; he didn&#8217;t feel much like singing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He ran back down to the common room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;d better put the Cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us &#8212; if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own &#8212;&#8221;
