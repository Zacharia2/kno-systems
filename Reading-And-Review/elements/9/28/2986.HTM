<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Hermione!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry &#8212; you&#8217;re a great wizard, you know.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not as good as you,&#8221; said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Me!&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;Books! And cleverness! There are more important things &#8212; friendship and bravery and &#8212; oh Harry &#8212; be careful!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You drink first,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;You are sure which is which, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH16M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Positive,&#8221; said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s not poison?&#8221; said Harry anxiously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No &#8212; but it&#8217;s like ice.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Quick, go, before it wears off.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good luck &#8212; take care &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;GO!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Here I come,&#8221; he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn&#8217;t feel them &#8212; for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire &#8212; then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was already someone there &#8212; but it wasn&#8217;t Snape. It wasn&#8217;t even Voldemort.</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>I</SPAN>t was Quirrell.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;You!&#8221;</I> gasped Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell smiled. His face wasn&#8217;t twitching at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Me,&#8221; he said calmly. &#8220;I wondered whether I&#8217;d be meeting you here, Potter.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But I thought &#8212; Snape &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Severus?&#8221; Quirrell laughed, and it wasn&#8217;t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. &#8220;Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn&#8217;t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?&#8221;
