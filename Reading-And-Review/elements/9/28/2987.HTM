<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row &#8212; Snape would never know what had happened.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.</P>
<P id=HP01CH11M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Neville, you can look!&#8221; Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid&#8217;s jacket for the last five minutes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick &#8212; he hit the field on all fours &#8212; coughed &#8212; and something gold fell into his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the Snitch!&#8221; he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,&#8221; Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference &#8212; Harry hadn&#8217;t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results &#8212; Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid&#8217;s hut, with Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was Snape,&#8221; Ron was explaining, &#8220;Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn&#8217;t take his eyes off you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; said Hagrid, who hadn&#8217;t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. &#8220;Why would Snape do somethin&#8217; like that?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.
