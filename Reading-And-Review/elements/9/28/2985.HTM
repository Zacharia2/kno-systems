<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Brilliant,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t magic &#8212; it&#8217;s logic &#8212; a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven&#8217;t got an ounce of logic, they&#8217;d be stuck in here forever.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But so will we, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But how do we know which to drink?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give me a minute.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire &#8212; toward the Stone.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked at the tiny bottle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s only enough there for one of us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s hardly one swallow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They looked at each other.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Which one will get you back through the purple flames?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You drink that,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they&#8217;ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy &#8212; go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I&#8217;m no match for him, really.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Harry &#8212; what if You-Know-Who&#8217;s with him?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; I was lucky once, wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221; said Harry, pointing at his scar. &#8220;I might get lucky again.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione&#8217;s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.
