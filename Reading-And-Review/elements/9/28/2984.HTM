<P id=HP01CH16M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next &#8212; but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Snape&#8217;s,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;What do we have to do?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn&#8217;t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look!&#8221; Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:</P>
<DIV class=block>

<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>One among us seven will let you move ahead,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Another will transport the drinker back instead,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Two among our number hold only nettle wine,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>First, however slyly the poison tries to hide</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>You will always find some on nettle wine&#8217;s left side;</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Second, different are those who stand at either end,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Fourth, the second left and the second on the right</I></P>
<P class=noindent>Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.</P></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
