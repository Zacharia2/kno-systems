<P id=HP01CH04M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant sat back down on the sofa,which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of thingsout of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy packageof sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottleof some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting tomake tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzlingsausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as heslid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from thepoker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply,&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant chuckled darkly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yer great puddin&#8217; of a son don&#8217; needfattenin&#8217; anymore, Dursley, don&#8217; worry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had nevertasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn&#8217;t take hiseyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explainanything, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I still don&#8217;treally know who you are.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the backof his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Call me Hagrid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;everyone does.An&#8217; like I told yeh, I&#8217;m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts&#8212; yeh&#8217;ll know all about Hogwarts, o&#8217;course.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; no,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked shocked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Harry said quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Sorry?&#8221;</I> barked Hagrid, turning to stare atthe Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. &#8220;It&#8217;sthem as should be sorry!
