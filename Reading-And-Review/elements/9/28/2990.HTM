<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A wizard, o&#8217; course,&#8221; said Hagrid, sittingback down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower,&#8220;an&#8217; a thumpin&#8217; good&#8217;un, I&#8217;d say,once yeh&#8217;ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an&#8217; dadlike yours, what else would yeh be? An&#8217; I reckon it&#8217;sabou&#8217; time yeh read yer letter.&#8221;</P>
