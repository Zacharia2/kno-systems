<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All what?&#8221; asked Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;ALL WHAT?&#8221; Hagrid thundered. &#8220;Now waitjus&#8217; one second!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill thewhole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you mean ter tell me,&#8221; he growled at theDursleys, &#8220;that this boy &#8212; this boy! &#8212; knowsnothin&#8217; abou&#8217;&#8212; about ANYTHING?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school,after all, and his marks weren&#8217;t bad.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know <I class=calibre9>some</I> things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can,you know, do math and stuff.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, &#8220;About<I class=calibre9>our</I> world, I mean. <I class=calibre9>Your</I> world. <I class=calibre9>My</I> world.<I class=calibre9>Yer parents&#8217; world.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What world?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;DURSLEY!&#8221; he boomed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something thatsounded like &#8220;Mimblewimble.&#8221; Hagrid stared wildly atHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But yeh must know about yer mum and dad,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I mean, they&#8217;re <I class=calibre9>famous.</I> You&#8217;re<I class=calibre9>famous.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What? My &#8212; my mum and dad weren&#8217;t famous,were they?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh don&#8217; know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yeh don&#8217;know&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; Hagrid ran his fingers through hishair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh don&#8217; know what yeh <I class=calibre9>are</I>?&#8221; he saidfinally.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Stop right there, sir!I forbid you to tell the boy anything!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under thefurious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his everysyllable trembled with rage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You never told him? Never told him what was in the letterDumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it,Dursley! An&#8217; you&#8217;ve kept it from him all theseyears?&#8221;
