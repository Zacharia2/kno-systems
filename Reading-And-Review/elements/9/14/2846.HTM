<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his headhurt. Then he said, &#8220;Sir, there are some other thingsI&#8217;d like to know, if you can tell me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.things I want to know the truthabout.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The truth.&#8221; Dumbledore sighed. &#8220;It is abeautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated withgreat caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I havea very good reason not to, in which case I beg you&#8217;ll forgiveme. I shall not, of course, lie.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Voldemort said that he onlykilled my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. Butwhy would he want to kill me in the first place?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Nottoday. Not now. You will know, one day&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. put itfrom your mind for now, Harry. When you areolder&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know you hate to hearthis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when you are ready, you willknow.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But why couldn&#8217;t Quirrell touch me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Your mother died to save you. If there is one thingVoldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn&#8217;t realizethat love as powerful as your mother&#8217;s for you leaves its ownmark. Not a scar, no visible sign&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to have beenloved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, willgive us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul withVoldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony totouch a person marked by something so good.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on thewindowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet.When he had found his voice again, Harry said, &#8220;And theInvisibility Cloak &#8212; do you know who sent it tome?&#8221;
