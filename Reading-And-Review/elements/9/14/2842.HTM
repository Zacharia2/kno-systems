<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;LIAR!&#8221; Harry shouted suddenly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort couldstill see him. The evil face was now smiling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How touching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; it hissed.&#8220;I always value bravery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, boy, yourparents were brave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I killed your fatherfirst, and he put up a courageous fight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. butyour mother needn&#8217;t have died&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she wastrying to protect you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now give me the Stone,unless you want her to have died in vain.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;NEVER!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed&#8220;SEIZE HIM!&#8221; and the next second, Harry feltQuirrell&#8217;s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharppain seared across Harry&#8217;s scar; his head felt as though itwas about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all hismight, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in hishead lessened &#8212; he looked around wildly to see where Quirrellhad gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers&#8212; they were blistering before his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Seize him! SEIZE HIM!&#8221; shrieked Voldemort again,and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing ontop of him, both hands around Harry&#8217;s neck &#8212;Harry&#8217;s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he couldsee Quirrell howling in agony.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Master, I cannot hold him &#8212; my hands &#8212; myhands!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees,let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms &#8212;Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Then kill him, fool, and be done!&#8221; screechedVoldemort.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry,by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell&#8217;s face&#8212;
