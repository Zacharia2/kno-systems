<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Tokens from your friends and admirers,&#8221; saidDumbledore, beaming. &#8220;What happened down in the dungeonsbetween you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so,naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends MistersFred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you atoilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. MadamPomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, andconfiscated it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How long have I been in here?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will bemost relieved you have come round, they have been extremelyworried.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But sir, the Stone &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone.Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived intime to prevent that, although you were doing very well on yourown, I must say.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You got there? You got Hermione&#8217;s owl?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reachedLondon than it became clear to me that the place I should be wasthe one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrelloff you &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was <I class=calibre9>you.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I feared I might be too late.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You nearly were, I couldn&#8217;t have kept him off theStone much longer &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not the Stone, boy, you &#8212; the effort involvednearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid ithad. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Destroyed?&#8221; said Harry blankly. &#8220;But yourfriend &#8212; Nicolas Flamel &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, you know about Nicolas?&#8221; said Dumbledore,sounding quite delighted. &#8220;You <I class=calibre9>did</I> do the thingproperly, didn&#8217;t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a littlechat, and agreed it&#8217;s all for the best.&#8221;
