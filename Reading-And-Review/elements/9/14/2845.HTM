<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But that means he and his wife will die, won&#8217;tthey?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs inorder and then, yes, they will die.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry&#8217;sface.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;To one as young as you, I&#8217;m sure it seemsincredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like goingto bed after a very, <I class=calibre9>very</I> long day. After all, to thewell-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. Youknow, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As muchmoney and life as you could want! The two things most human beingswould choose above all &#8212; the trouble is, humans do have aknack of choosing precisely those things that are worst forthem.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little andsmiled at the ceiling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sir?&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve beenthinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sir &#8212; even if the Stone&#8217;sgone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name forthings. Fear of a name increases fear of the thingitself.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort&#8217;s going to try other waysof coming back, isn&#8217;t he? I mean, he hasn&#8217;t gone, hashe?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere,perhaps looking for another body to share&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. notbeing truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; heshows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return topower, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fightwhat seems a losing battle next time &#8212; and if he is delayedagain, and again, why, he may never return to power.&#8221;
