<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The high voice spoke again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let me speak to him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.face-to-face.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Master, you are not strong enough!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I have strength enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. forthis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt as if Devil&#8217;s Snare was rooting him to thespot. He couldn&#8217;t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched asQuirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was goingon? The turban fell away. Quirrell&#8217;s head looked strangelysmall without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry would have screamed, but he couldn&#8217;t make a sound.Where there should have been a back to Quirrell&#8217;s head, therewas a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It waschalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like asnake.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry Potter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; itwhispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn&#8217;tmove.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See what I have become?&#8221; the face said. &#8220;Mereshadow and vapor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have form only when I canshare another&#8217;s body&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there havealways been those willing to let me into their hearts andminds.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Unicorn blood has strengthened me,these past weeks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you saw faithful Quirrelldrinking it for me in the forest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and once Ihave the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of myown.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why don&#8217;tyou give me that Stone in your pocket?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry&#8217;slegs. He stumbled backward.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool,&#8221; snarled the face.&#8220;Better save your own life and join me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.or you&#8217;ll meet the same end as yourparents.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They died begging me formercy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
