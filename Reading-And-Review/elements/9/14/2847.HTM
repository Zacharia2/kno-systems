<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah &#8212; your father happened to leave it in mypossession, and I thought you might like it.&#8221;Dumbledore&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;Usefulthings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your father used it mainly for sneakingoff to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And there&#8217;s somethingelse&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fire away.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Quirrell said Snape &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Professor</I> Snape, Harry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, him &#8212; Quirrell said he hates me because hehated my father. Is that true?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlikeyourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snapecould never forgive.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He saved his life.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;What?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; said Dumbledore dreamily.&#8220;Funny, the way people&#8217;s minds work, isn&#8217;t it?Professor Snape couldn&#8217;t bear being in your father&#8217;sdebt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do believe he worked so hard toprotect you this year because he felt that would make him and yourfather even. Then he could go back to hating your father&#8217;smemory in peace.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so hestopped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And sir, there&#8217;s one morething&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just the one?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, now, I&#8217;m glad you asked me that. It was one ofmy more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that&#8217;ssaying something. You see, only one who wanted to <I class=calibre9>find</I> theStone &#8212; find it, but not use it &#8212; would be able to getit, otherwise they&#8217;d just see themselves making gold ordrinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even mesometimes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, enough questions. I suggestyou make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott&#8217;s EveryFlavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across avomit-flavored one, and since then I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;verather lost my liking for them &#8212; but I think I&#8217;ll besafe with a nice toffee, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
