<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;D&#8217;you think he meant you to do it?&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;Sending you your father&#8217;s Cloak andeverything?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Well,&#8221;</I> Hermione exploded, &#8220;if he did&#8212; I mean to say &#8212; that&#8217;s terrible &#8212; youcould have been killed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry thoughtfully.&#8220;He&#8217;s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort ofwanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or lesseverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a prettygood idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he justtaught us enough to help. I don&#8217;t think it was an accident helet me find out how the mirror worked. It&#8217;s almost like hethought I had the right to face Voldemort if Icould.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah, Dumbledore&#8217;s off his rocker, allright,&#8221; said Ron proudly. &#8220;Listen, you&#8217;ve got tobe up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in andSlytherin won, of course &#8212; you missed the last Quidditchmatch, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you &#8212; butthe food&#8217;ll be good.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,&#8221;she said firmly.</P>
<P class=break>After a good night&#8217;s sleep, Harry feltnearly back to normal.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want to go to the feast,&#8221; he told Madam Pomfreyas she straightened his many candy boxes. &#8220;I can, can&#8217;tI?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed togo,&#8221; she said sniffily, as though in her opinion ProfessorDumbledore didn&#8217;t realize how risky feasts could be.&#8220;And you have another visitor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, good,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he wasindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next toHarry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.
