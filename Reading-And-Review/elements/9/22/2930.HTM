<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,&#8221; he stammered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, &#8220;You tell him, Neville.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Longbottom, if brains were gold you&#8217;d be poorer than Weasley, and that&#8217;s saying something.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron&#8217;s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m warning you, Malfoy &#8212; one more word &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ron!&#8221; said Hermione suddenly, &#8220;Harry &#8212; !&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What? Where?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re in luck, Weasley, Potter&#8217;s obviously spotted some money on the ground!&#8221; said Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on, Harry!&#8221; Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape &#8212; she didn&#8217;t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches &#8212; the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.
