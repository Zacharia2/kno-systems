<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville&#8217;s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thanks, Harry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think I&#8217;ll go to bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. D&#8217;you want the card, you collect them, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH13M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dumbledore again,&#8221; he said, &#8220;He was the first one I ever &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found him!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found Flamel! I told you I&#8217;d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here &#8212; listen to this: &#8216;Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon&#8217;s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel&#8217;!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn&#8217;t looked so excited since they&#8217;d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stay there!&#8221; she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls&#8217; dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I never thought to look in here!&#8221; she whispered excitedly. &#8220;I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Light?&#8221; said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she&#8217;d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last she found what she was looking for.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I knew it! I <I class=calibre9>knew</I> it!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are we allowed to speak yet?&#8221; said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nicolas Flamel,&#8221; she whispered dramatically, &#8220;is the only known maker of the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone!&#8221;
