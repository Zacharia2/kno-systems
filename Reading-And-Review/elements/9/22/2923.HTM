<P class=first>Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he&#8217;d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn&#8217;t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,&#8221; said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (&#8220;If Filch had caught you!&#8221;), and disappointment that he hadn&#8217;t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he&#8217;d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn&#8217;t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood&#8217;s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.
