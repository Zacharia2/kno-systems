<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to play,&#8221; he told Ron and Hermione. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t, all the Slytherins will think I&#8217;m just too scared to face Snape. I&#8217;ll show them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#8217;ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just as long as we&#8217;re not wiping you off the field,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=break>As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn&#8217;t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they&#8217;d found out about the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone? Harry didn&#8217;t see how he could &#8212; yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.</P>
<P class=break>Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they&#8217;d ever see him alive again. This wasn&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood&#8217;s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn&#8217;t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They&#8217;d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
