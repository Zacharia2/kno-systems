<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t forget, it&#8217;s Locomotor Mortis,&#8221; Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Ron snapped. &#8220;Don&#8217;t nag.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it&#8217;s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The whole school&#8217;s out there!&#8221; said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. &#8220;Even &#8212; blimey &#8212; Dumbledore&#8217;s come to watch!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s heart did a somersault.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dumbledore?&#8221; he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen Snape look so mean,&#8221; he told Hermione. &#8220;Look &#8212; they&#8217;re off. Ouch!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn&#8217;t see you there.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wonder how long Potter&#8217;s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron didn&#8217;t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?&#8221; said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. &#8220;It&#8217;s people they feel sorry for. See, there&#8217;s Potter, who&#8217;s got no parents, then there&#8217;s the Weasleys, who&#8217;ve got no money &#8212; you should be on the team, Longbottom, you&#8217;ve got no brains.&#8221;
