<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This didn&#8217;t have quite the effect she&#8217;d expected.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The what?&#8221; said Harry and Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, honestly, don&#8217;t you two read? Look &#8212; read that, there.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:</P>

<P class=noindent>The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There have been many reports of the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>&#8220;See?&#8221; said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. &#8220;The dog must be guarding Flamel&#8217;s Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they&#8217;re friends and he knew someone was after it, that&#8217;s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;No wonder Snape&#8217;s after it! Anyone would want it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And no wonder we couldn&#8217;t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;He&#8217;s not exactly recent if he&#8217;s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH13M01E class=break>The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they&#8217;d do with a Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone if they had one. It wasn&#8217;t until Ron said he&#8217;d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
