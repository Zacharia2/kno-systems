<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t play,&#8221; said Hermione at once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Say you&#8217;re ill,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Pretend to break your leg,&#8221; Hermione suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Really</I> break your leg,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can&#8217;t play at all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone&#8217;s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville&#8217;s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy,&#8221; said Neville shakily. &#8220;I met him outside the library. He said he&#8217;d been looking for someone to practice that on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to Professor McGonagall!&#8221; Hermione urged Neville. &#8220;Report him!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville shook his head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want more trouble,&#8221; he mumbled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to stand up to him, Neville!&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;He&#8217;s used to walking all over people, but that&#8217;s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to tell me I&#8217;m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy&#8217;s already done that,&#8221; Neville choked out.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re worth twelve of Malfoy,&#8221; Harry said. &#8220;The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn&#8217;t it? And where&#8217;s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.&#8221;
