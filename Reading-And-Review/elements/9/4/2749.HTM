<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downwardafter the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seenit, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch &#8212; allthe Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to bedoing as they hung in midair to watch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was faster than Higgs &#8212; he could see the littleround ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead &#8212; he put on anextra spurt of speed &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below &#8212;Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry&#8217;s broomspun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Foul!&#8221; screamed the Gryffindors.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shotat the goalposts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, ofcourse, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, &#8220;Send himoff, ref! Red card!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you talking about, Dean?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Red card!&#8221; said Dean furiously. &#8220;In socceryou get shown the red card and you&#8217;re out of thegame!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t soccer, Dean,&#8221; Ron remindedhim.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid, however, was on Dean&#8217;s side.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harryoutta the air.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So &#8212; after that obvious and disgusting bit ofcheating &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Jordan!&#8221; growled Professor McGonagall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I mean, after that open and revolting foul&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Jordan, I&#8217;m warning you &#8212;&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the GryffindorSeeker, which could happen to anyone, I&#8217;m sure, so a penaltyto Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, andwe continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.&#8221;
