<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to eat some breakfast.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just a bit of toast,&#8221; wheedled Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt terrible. In an hour&#8217;s time he&#8217;d bewalking onto the field.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry, you need your strength,&#8221; said SeamusFinnigan. &#8220;Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered bythe other team.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thanks, Seamus,&#8221; said Harry, watching Seamus pileketchup on his sausages.</P>
<P id=HP01CH11M02S class=break>By eleven o&#8217;clockthe whole school seemed to be out in the stands around theQuidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might beraised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what wasgoing on sometimes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Hamfan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted alarge banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said<I class=calibre9>Potter for President,</I> and Dean, who was good at drawing, haddone a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione hadperformed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed differentcolors.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the teamwere changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin wouldbe playing in green).</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood cleared his throat for silence.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Okay, men,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And women,&#8221; said Chaser Angelina Johnson.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And women,&#8221; Wood agreed. &#8220;This isit.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The big one,&#8221; said Fred Weasley.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The one we&#8217;ve all been waiting for,&#8221; saidGeorge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We know Oliver&#8217;s speech by heart,&#8221; Fred toldHarry, &#8220;we were on the team last year.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up, you two,&#8221; said Wood. &#8220;This is thebest team Gryffindor&#8217;s had in years. We&#8217;re going towin. I know it.&#8221;
