<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at thefloor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a small voice came out of the shadows.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Please, Professor McGonagall &#8212; they were lookingfor me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Miss Granger!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I went looking for the troll because I &#8212; I thoughtI could deal with it on my own &#8212; you know, because I&#8217;veread all about them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lieto a teacher?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t found me, I&#8217;d be dead now.Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with itsown club. They didn&#8217;t have time to come and fetch anyone. Itwas about to finish me off when they arrived.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn&#8217;tnew to them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; in that case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them,&#8220;Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think oftackling a mountain troll on your own?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was thelast person to do anything against the rules, and here she was,pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snapehad started handing out sweets.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindorfor this,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall. &#8220;I&#8217;m verydisappointed in you. If you&#8217;re not hurt at all, you&#8217;dbetter get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing thefeast in their Houses.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione left.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many firstyears could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each winGryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed ofthis. You may go.&#8221;
