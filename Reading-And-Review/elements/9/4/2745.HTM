<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;POTTER!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape&#8217;s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robesquickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I just wondered if I could have my book back.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;GET OUT! <I class=calibre9>OUT!</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry left, before Snape could take any more points fromGryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Did you get it?&#8221; Ron asked as Harry joined them.&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>In a low whisper, Harry told them what he&#8217;d seen.</P>
<P id=HP01CH11M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know what thismeans?&#8221; he finished breathlessly. &#8220;He tried to get pastthat three-headed dog at Halloween! That&#8217;s where he was goingwhen we saw him &#8212; he&#8217;s after whatever it&#8217;sguarding! And I&#8217;d bet my broomstick <I class=calibre9>he</I> let that trollin, to make a diversion!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione&#8217;s eyes were wide.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No &#8212; he wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Iknow he&#8217;s not very nice, but he wouldn&#8217;t try and stealsomething Dumbledore was keeping safe.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints orsomething,&#8221; snapped Ron. &#8220;I&#8217;m with Harry. Iwouldn&#8217;t put anything past Snape. But what&#8217;s he after?What&#8217;s that dog guarding?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question.Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn&#8217;t sleep. Hetried to empty his mind &#8212; he needed to sleep, he had to, hehad his first Quidditch match in a few hours &#8212; but theexpression on Snape&#8217;s face when Harry had seen his legwasn&#8217;t easy to forget.</P>
<P class=break>The next morning dawned very bright and cold. TheGreat Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages andthe cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a goodQuidditch match.
