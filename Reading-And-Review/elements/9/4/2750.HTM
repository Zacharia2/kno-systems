<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinningdangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave asudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he wasgoing to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands andknees. He&#8217;d never felt anything like that.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buckhim off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to bucktheir riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindorgoalposts &#8212; he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out&#8212; and then he realized that his broom was completely out ofhis control. He couldn&#8217;t turn it. He couldn&#8217;t direct itat all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and thenmaking violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Lee was still commentating.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed thatHarry&#8217;s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying himslowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as itwent.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dunno what Harry thinks he&#8217;s doing,&#8221; Hagridmumbled. He stared through his binoculars. &#8220;If I didn&#8217;know better, I&#8217;d say he&#8217;d lost control of hisbroom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he can&#8217;thave.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only justmanaging to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry&#8217;sbroom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was nowdangling from it, holding on with only one hand.
