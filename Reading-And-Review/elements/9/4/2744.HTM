<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve got there,Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was <I class=calibre9>Quidditch Through the Ages.</I> Harry showed him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Library books are not to be taken outside theschool,&#8221; said Snape. &#8220;Give it to me. Five points fromGryffindor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s just made that rule up,&#8221; Harry mutteredangrily as Snape limped away. &#8220;Wonder what&#8217;s wrong withhis leg?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dunno, but I hope it&#8217;s really hurting him,&#8221;said Ron bitterly.</P>
<P id=HP01CH11M01S class=break>The Gryffindor commonroom was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sattogether next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry andRon&#8217;s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy(&#8220;How will you learn?&#8221;), but by asking her to read itthrough, they got the right answers anyway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt restless. He wanted <I class=calibre9>Quidditch Through the Ages</I>back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should hebe afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he wasgoing to ask Snape if he could have it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Better you than me,&#8221; they said together, but Harryhad an idea that Snape wouldn&#8217;t refuse if there were otherteachers listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was noanswer. He knocked again. Nothing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. Hepushed the door ajar and peered inside &#8212; and a horrible scenemet his eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robesabove his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch washanding Snape bandages.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Blasted thing,&#8221; Snape was saying. &#8220;How areyou supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads atonce?&#8221;
