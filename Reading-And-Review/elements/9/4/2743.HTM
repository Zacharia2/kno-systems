<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that,as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But thenews that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harrydidn&#8217;t know which was worse &#8212; people telling himhe&#8217;d be brilliant or people telling him they&#8217;d berunning around underneath him holding a mattress.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. Hedidn&#8217;t know how he&#8217;d have gotten through all hishomework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditchpractice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him<I class=calibre9>Quidditch Through the Ages,</I> which turned out to be a veryinteresting read.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing aQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cupmatch in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastestplayers, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happento them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch,referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in theSahara Desert.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rulessince Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and shewas much nicer for it. The day before Harry&#8217;s first Quidditchmatch the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard duringbreak, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that couldbe carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backsto it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed atonce that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closertogether to block the fire from view; they were sure itwouldn&#8217;t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about theirguilty faces caught Snape&#8217;s eye. He limped over. Hehadn&#8217;t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for areason to tell them off anyway.
