<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furioussnowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping forbreath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room,where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly toRon. He suspected he wouldn&#8217;t have lost so badly if Percyhadn&#8217;t tried to help him so much.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, andChristmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much beforebed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all overGryffindor Tower because they&#8217;d stolen his prefect badge.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It had been Harry&#8217;s best Christmas day ever. Yet somethinghad been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until heclimbed into bed was he free to think about it: the InvisibilityCloak and whoever had sent it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious tobother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he&#8217;d drawn thecurtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his ownbed and pulled the Cloak out from under it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His father&#8217;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this had been hisfather&#8217;s. He let the material flow over his hands, smootherthan silk, light as air. <I class=calibre9>Use it well,</I> the note had said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped theCloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw onlymoonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>Use it well.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was opento him in this Cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stoodthere in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this,anywhere, and Filch would never know.
