<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, andthere, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry lookedover his shoulder &#8212; but still, no one was there. Or were theyall invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisiblepeople and this mirror&#8217;s trick was that it reflected them,invisible or not?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind hisreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand andfelt the air behind him. If she was really there, he&#8217;d touchher, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air&#8212; she and the others existed only in the mirror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes&#8212; <I class=calibre9>her eyes are just like mine,</I> Harry thought, edging alittle closer to the glass. Bright green &#8212; exactly the sameshape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but cryingat the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next toher put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was veryuntidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry&#8217;s did.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearlytouching that of his reflection.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mum?&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Dad?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked intothe faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs ofgreen eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old manwho looked as though he had Harry&#8217;s knobbly knees &#8212;Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in hislife.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrilyback at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though hewas hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had apowerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terriblesadness.
