<P class=noindent>There was no signature. Harry stared at thenote. Ron was admiring the Cloak.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d give <I class=calibre9>anything</I> for one of these,&#8221;he said. &#8220;<I class=calibre9>Anything.</I> What&#8217;s thematter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Harry. He felt very strange. Who hadsent the Cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory doorwas flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harrystuffed the Cloak quickly out of sight. He didn&#8217;t feel likesharing it with anyone else yet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Merry Christmas!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hey, look &#8212; Harry&#8217;s got a Weasley sweater,too!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a largeyellow F on it, the other a G.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry&#8217;s is better than ours, though,&#8221; saidFred, holding up Harry&#8217;s sweater. &#8220;She obviously makesmore of an effort if you&#8217;re not family.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you wearing yours, Ron?&#8221; Georgedemanded. &#8220;Come on, get it on, they&#8217;re lovely andwarm.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I hate maroon,&#8221; Ron moaned halfheartedly as hepulled it over his head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got a letter on yours,&#8221; Georgeobserved. &#8220;I suppose she thinks you don&#8217;t forget yourname. But we&#8217;re not stupid &#8212; we know we&#8217;re calledGred and Forge.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this noise?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, lookingdisapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping hispresents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, whichFred seized.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we&#8217;re allwearing ours, even Harry got one.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I &#8212; don&#8217;t &#8212; want &#8212;&#8221; saidPercy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head,knocking his glasses askew.
