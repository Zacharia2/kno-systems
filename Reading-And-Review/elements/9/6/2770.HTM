<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s here &#8212; just here &#8212; yes!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the Cloak from aroundhis shoulders and ran to the mirror.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight ofhim.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See?&#8221; Harry whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see anything.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look! Look at them all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there areloads of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I can only see you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, hecouldn&#8217;t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisleypajamas.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look at me!&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can you see all your family standing aroundyou?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No &#8212; I&#8217;m alone &#8212; but I&#8217;mdifferent &#8212; I look older &#8212; and I&#8217;m HeadBoy!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;What?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I am &#8212; I&#8217;m wearing the badge like Bill usedto &#8212; and I&#8217;m holding the House Cup and the QuidditchCup &#8212; I&#8217;m Quidditch captain, too!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to lookexcitedly at Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you think this mirror shows the future?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How can it? All my family are dead &#8212; let me haveanother look &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit moretime.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what&#8217;sinteresting about that? I want to see my parents.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push me &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to theirdiscussion. They hadn&#8217;t realized how loudly they had beentalking.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Quick!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron threw the Cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs.Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, boththinking the same thing &#8212; did the Cloak work on cats? Afterwhat seemed an age, she turned and left.
