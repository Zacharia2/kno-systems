<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence &#8212; thebook was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went onand on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backwardand knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, heheard footsteps coming down the corridor outside &#8212; stuffingthe shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passedFilch in the doorway; Filch&#8217;s pale, wild eyes looked straightthrough him, and Harry slipped under Filch&#8217;s outstretched armand streaked off up the corridor, the book&#8217;s shrieks stillringing in his ears.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. Hehad been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn&#8217;tpaid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark,he didn&#8217;t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit ofarmor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors abovethere.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, ifanyone was wandering around at night, and somebody&#8217;s been inthe library &#8212; Restricted Section.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was,Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice wasgetting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied,&#8220;The Restricted Section? Well, they can&#8217;t be far,we&#8217;ll catch them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came aroundthe corner ahead. They couldn&#8217;t see him, of course, but itwas a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they&#8217;dknock right into him &#8212; the Cloak didn&#8217;t stop him frombeing solid.
