<P class=epubfirstparagraph>How long he stood there, he didn&#8217;t know. The reflectionsdid not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise broughthim back to his senses. He couldn&#8217;t stay here, he had to findhis way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother&#8217;sface, whispered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come back,&#8221; and hurriedfrom the room.</P>
<P class=break>&#8220;You could have woken me up,&#8221; saidRon, crossly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can come tonight, I&#8217;m going back, I want toshow you the mirror.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see your mum and dad,&#8221; Ron saideagerly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys,you&#8217;ll be able to show me your other brothers andeveryone.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can see them any old time,&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it onlyshows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Havesome bacon or something, why aren&#8217;t you eatinganything?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t eat. He had seen his parents and would beseeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. Itdidn&#8217;t seem very important anymore. Who cared what thethree-headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stoleit, really?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;You lookodd.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>What Harry feared most was that he might not beable to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the Cloak,too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They triedretracing Harry&#8217;s route from the library, wandering aroundthe dark passageways for nearly an hour.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m freezing,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Let&#8217;sforget it and go back.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;No!&#8221;</I> Harry hissed. &#8220;I know it&#8217;shere somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the oppositedirection, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning thathis feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
