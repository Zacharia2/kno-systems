<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Every year she makes us a sweater,&#8221; said Ron,unwrapping his own, &#8220;and mine&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>always</I>maroon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s really nice of her,&#8221; said Harry,trying the fudge, which was very tasty.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His next present also contained candy &#8212; a large box ofChocolate Frogs from Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. Itwas very light. He unwrapped it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floorwhere it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of those,&#8221; he said in a hushedvoice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he&#8217;d gottenfrom Hermione. &#8220;If that&#8217;s what I think it is &#8212;they&#8217;re really rare, and <I class=calibre9>really</I> valuable.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It wasstrange to the touch, like water woven into material.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s an Invisibility Cloak,&#8221; said Ron, a lookof awe on his face. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it is &#8212; try iton.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry threw the Cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave ayell.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It <I class=calibre9>is</I>! Look down!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed tothe mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, justhis head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. Hepulled the Cloak over his head and his reflection vanishedcompletely.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s a note!&#8221; said Ron suddenly. &#8220;Anote fell out of it!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry pulled off the Cloak and seized the letter. Written innarrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the followingwords:</P>
<DIV class=block>
