He squeezed through it, holding hisbreath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to getinside the room without their noticing anything. They walkedstraight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply,listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, veryclose. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about theroom he had hidden in.</P>

His heart waspounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed &#8212;for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowdof people standing right behind him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowlyback to the mirror.
