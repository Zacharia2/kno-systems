<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not sitting with the prefects today,either,&#8221; said George. &#8220;Christmas is a time forfamily.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to hisside by his sweater.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M02S class=break>Harry had never in allhis life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys;mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy andcranberry sauce &#8212; and stacks of wizard crackers every fewfeet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothinglike the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with theirlittle plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harrypulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn&#8217;t just bang, itwent off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in acloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rearadmiral&#8217;s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the HighTable, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard&#8217;s hat for aflowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke ProfessorFlitwick had just read him.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>Flaming Christmas puddings followedthe turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickleembedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder andredder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissingProfessor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry&#8217;s amazement,giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with astack of things out of the crackers, including a pack ofnon-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, andhis own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared andHarry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs.Norris&#8217;s Christmas dinner.
