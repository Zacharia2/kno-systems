<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something heldhim back &#8212; his father&#8217;s Cloak &#8212; he felt that thistime &#8212; the first time &#8212; he wanted to use it alone.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across thecommon room, and climbed through the portrait hole.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; squawked the Fat Lady. Harrysaid nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought.And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library.He&#8217;d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it tookto find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the InvisibilityCloak tight around him as he walked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp tosee his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it wasfloating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his armsupporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books fromthe rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read thetitles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They didn&#8217;t tell him much. Their peeling, faded goldletters spelled words in languages Harry couldn&#8217;t understand.Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it thatlooked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry&#8217;sneck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thoughta faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knewsomeone was there who shouldn&#8217;t be.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully onthe floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for aninteresting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caughthis eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was veryheavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.
