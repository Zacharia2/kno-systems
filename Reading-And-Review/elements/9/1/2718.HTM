<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened thedoor and poked her head inside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for amoment?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was goingto use on him?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy whocame out of Flitwick&#8217;s class looking confused.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Follow me, you two,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall, andthey marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously atHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;In here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that wasempty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on theblackboard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Out, Peeves!&#8221; she barked. Peeves threw the chalkinto a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to facethe two boys.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood &#8212; I&#8217;vefound you a Seeker.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood&#8217;s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you serious, Professor?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall crisply.&#8220;The boy&#8217;s a natural. I&#8217;ve never seen anythinglike it. Was that your first time on a broomstick,Potter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry nodded silently. He didn&#8217;t have a clue what wasgoing on, but he didn&#8217;t seem to be being expelled, and someof the feeling started coming back to his legs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-footdive,&#8221; Professor McGonagall told Wood. &#8220;Didn&#8217;teven scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn&#8217;t have doneit.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true atonce.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?&#8221; he askedexcitedly.
