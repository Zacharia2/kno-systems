<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come back, boy!&#8221; she shouted, but Neville wasrising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle &#8212; twelvefeet &#8212; twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look downat the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off thebroom and &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>WHAM &#8212; a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedownon the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher andhigher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest andout of sight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white ashis.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Broken wrist,&#8221; Harry heard her mutter. &#8220;Comeon, boy &#8212; it&#8217;s all right, up you get.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She turned to the rest of the class.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;None of you is to move while I take this boy to thehospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are oryou&#8217;ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say&#8216;Quidditch.&#8217; Come on, dear.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbledoff with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst intolaughter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Did you see his face, the great lump?&#8221;</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Malfoy, darting forward and snatchingsomething out of the grass. &#8220;It&#8217;s that stupid thingLongbottom&#8217;s gran sent him.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give that here, Malfoy,&#8221; said Harry quietly.Everyone stopped talking to watch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy smiled nastily.
