<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not telling you what wasin there, so keep your noses out if you know what&#8217;s good foryou,&#8221; said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>Harry remembered Ron telling him on the trainthat someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn&#8217;tmentioned the date.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid!&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;that Gringotts break-inhappened on my birthday! It might&#8217;ve been happening while wewere there!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn&#8217;t meetHarry&#8217;s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him anotherrock cake. Harry read the story again. <I class=calibre9>The vault that wassearched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.</I> Hagridhad emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call itemptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been whatthe thieves were looking for?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, theirpockets weighed down with rock cakes they&#8217;d been too politeto refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he&#8217;d had sofar had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. HadHagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? Anddid Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn&#8217;t want totell Harry?</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>H</SPAN>arry had never believedhe would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was beforehe met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potionswith the Slytherins, so they didn&#8217;t have to put up withMalfoy much. Or at least, they didn&#8217;t until they spotted anotice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them allgroan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday &#8212; andGryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.
