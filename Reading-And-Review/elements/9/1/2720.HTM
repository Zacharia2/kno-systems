<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I tell you, we&#8217;re going to win that Quidditch Cupfor sure this year,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t wonsince Charlie left, but this year&#8217;s team is going to bebrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping whenhe told us.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Anyway, we&#8217;ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckonshe&#8217;s found a new secret passageway out of theschool.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bet it&#8217;s that one behind the statue of Gregory theSmarmy that we found in our first week. See you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far lesswelcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting thetrain back to the Muggles?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lot braver now that you&#8217;re back onthe ground and you&#8217;ve got your little friends withyou,&#8221; said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at alllittle about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full ofteachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knucklesand scowl.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;d take you on anytime on my own,&#8221; saidMalfoy. &#8220;Tonight, if you want. Wizard&#8217;s duel. Wandsonly &#8212; no contact. What&#8217;s the matter? Never heard of awizard&#8217;s duel before, I suppose?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course he has,&#8221; said Ron, wheeling around.&#8220;I&#8217;m his second, who&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Crabbe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Midnight all right?We&#8217;ll meet you in the trophy room; that&#8217;s alwaysunlocked.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What <I class=calibre9>is</I> a wizard&#8217;s duel?&#8221; said Harry.&#8220;And what do you mean, you&#8217;re my second?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, a second&#8217;s there to take over if youdie,&#8221; said Ron casually, getting started at last on his coldpie. Catching the look on Harry&#8217;s face, he added quickly,&#8220;But people only die in proper duels, you know, with realwizards. The most you and Malfoy&#8217;ll be able to do is sendsparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do anyreal damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.&#8221;
