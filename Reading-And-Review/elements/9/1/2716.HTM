<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom tofind &#8212; how about &#8212; up a tree?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give it <I class=calibre9>here</I>!&#8221; Harry yelled, but Malfoy hadleapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn&#8217;t beenlying, he <I class=calibre9>could</I> fly well. Hovering level with the topmostbranches of an oak he called, &#8220;Come and get it,Potter!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry grabbed his broom.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;No!&#8221;</I> shouted Hermione Granger. &#8220;MadamHooch told us not to move &#8212; you&#8217;ll get us all intotrouble.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mountedthe broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared;air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him&#8212; and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he&#8217;d foundsomething he could do without being taught &#8212; this was easy,this was <I class=calibre9>wonderful.</I> He pulled his broomstick up a little totake it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back onthe ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.Malfoy looked stunned.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Give it here,&#8221; Harry called, &#8220;or I&#8217;llknock you off that broom!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, yeah?&#8221; said Malfoy, trying to sneer, butlooking worried.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and graspedthe broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like ajavelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made asharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below wereclapping.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck,Malfoy,&#8221; Harry called.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Catch it if you can,then!&#8221; he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into theair and streaked back toward the ground.
