<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Typical,&#8221; said Harry darkly. &#8220;Just what Ialways wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front ofMalfoy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He had been looking forward to learning to fly more thananything else.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;ll make a fool ofyourself,&#8221; said Ron reasonably. &#8220;Anyway, I knowMalfoy&#8217;s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch,but I bet that&#8217;s all talk.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot.

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because hisgrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry feltshe&#8217;d had good reason, because Neville managed to have anextraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on theground.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Nevillewas. This was something you couldn&#8217;t learn by heart out of abook &#8212; not that she hadn&#8217;t tried. At breakfast onThursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she&#8217;dgotten out of a library book called
