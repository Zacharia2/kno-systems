<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the airand then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broomhandle down &#8212; next second he was gathering speed in a steepdive, racing the ball &#8212; wind whistled in his ears, mingledwith the screams of people watching &#8212; he stretched out hishand &#8212; a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time topull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass withthe Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>His heart sank faster than he&#8217;d just dived. ProfessorMcGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet,trembling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Never</I> &#8212; in all my time at Hogwarts&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and herglasses flashed furiously, &#8220;&#8212; how <I class=calibre9>dare</I> you&#8212; might have broken your neck &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his fault, Professor &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Be quiet, Miss Patil &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Malfoy &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>enough,</I> Mr. Weasley. Potter, followme, now.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle&#8217;striumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in ProfessorMcGonagall&#8217;s wake as she strode toward the castle. He wasgoing to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say somethingto defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with hisvoice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even lookingat him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he&#8217;d done it. Hehadn&#8217;t even lasted two weeks. He&#8217;d be packing his bagsin ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up onthe doorstep?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and stillProfessor McGonagall didn&#8217;t say a word to him. She wrenchedopen doors and marched along corridors with Harry trottingmiserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. Hethought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.Perhaps he could be Hagrid&#8217;s assistant. His stomach twistedas he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizardswhile he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid&#8217;sbag.
