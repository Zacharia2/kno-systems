<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wood&#8217;s captain of the Gryffindor team,&#8221;Professor McGonagall explained.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s just the build for a Seeker, too,&#8221; saidWood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. &#8220;Light&#8212; speedy &#8212; we&#8217;ll have to get him a decent broom,Professor &#8212; a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,I&#8217;d say.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if wecan&#8217;t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need abetter team than last year. <I class=calibre9>Flattened</I> in that last match bySlytherin, I couldn&#8217;t look Severus Snape in the face forweeks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses atHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want to hear you&#8217;re training hard, Potter, or Imay change my mind about punishing you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then she suddenly smiled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Your father would have been proud,&#8221; she said.&#8220;He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>&#8220;You&#8217;re <I class=calibre9>joking.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what hadhappened when he&#8217;d left the grounds with ProfessorMcGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to hismouth, but he&#8217;d forgotten all about it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Seeker?&#8221;</I> he said. &#8220;But first years<I class=calibre9>never</I> &#8212; you must be the youngest House player in about&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; a century,&#8221; said Harry, shoveling pie intohis mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of theafternoon. &#8220;Wood told me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped atHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I start training next week,&#8221; said Harry.&#8220;Only don&#8217;t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it asecret.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry,and hurried over.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; said George in a low voice. &#8220;Woodtold us. We&#8217;re on the team too &#8212; Beaters.&#8221;
