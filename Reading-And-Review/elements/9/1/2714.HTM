<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The Slytherins were already there, and so were twentybroomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fredand George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying thatsome of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or alwaysflew slightly to the left.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair,and yellow eyes like a hawk.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, what are you all waiting for?&#8221; she barked.&#8220;Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurryup.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of thetwigs stuck out at odd angles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stick out your right hand over your broom,&#8221; calledMadam Hooch at the front, &#8220;and say&#8216;Up!&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;UP!&#8221; everyone shouted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was oneof the few that did. Hermione Granger&#8217;s had simply rolledover on the ground, and Neville&#8217;s hadn&#8217;t moved at all.Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid,thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville&#8217;s voice thatsaid only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on theground.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms withoutsliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correctingtheir grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoyhe&#8217;d been doing it wrong for years.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from theground, hard,&#8221; said Madam Hooch. &#8220;Keep your broomssteady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down byleaning forward slightly. On my whistle &#8212; three &#8212; two&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left onthe ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched MadamHooch&#8217;s lips.
