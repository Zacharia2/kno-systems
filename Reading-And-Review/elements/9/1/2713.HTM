<I class=calibre9>Quidditch Through theAges.</I> Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate foranything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, buteverybody else was very pleased when Hermione&#8217;s lecture wasinterrupted by the arrival of the mail. 
<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry hadn&#8217;t had a single letter since Hagrid&#8217;snote, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.Malfoy&#8217;s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweetsfrom home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother.He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of alarge marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Remembrall!&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Granknows I forget things &#8212; this tells you if there&#8217;ssomething you&#8217;ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tightlike this and if it turns red &#8212;oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; His face fell, because theRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.you&#8217;ve forgotten something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville was trying to remember what he&#8217;d forgotten whenDraco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched theRemembrall out of his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for areason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spottrouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in aflash.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy&#8217;s got my Remembrall, Professor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on thetable.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just looking,&#8221; he said, and he sloped away withCrabbe and Goyle behind him.</P>
<P class=break>At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, andthe other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the groundsfor their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and thegrass rippled under their feet as they marched down the slopinglawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of thegrounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly inthe distance.
