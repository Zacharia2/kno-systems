<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained fromhis face &#8212; he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Someone was lookin&#8217; through the gap in the curtains&#8212; it&#8217;s a kid &#8212; he&#8217;s runnin&#8217; back upter the school.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distancethere was no mistaking him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy had seen the dragon.</P>
<P class=break>Something about the smile lurking onMalfoy&#8217;s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, andHermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time inHagrid&#8217;s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just let him go,&#8221; Harry urged. &#8220;Set himfree.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;He&#8217;s toolittle. He&#8217;d die.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length injust a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagridhadn&#8217;t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragonwas keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles andchicken feathers all over the floor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to call him Norbert,&#8221; saidHagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. &#8220;He reallyknows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where&#8217;sMummy?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s lost his marbles,&#8221; Ron muttered inHarry&#8217;s ear.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid,&#8221; said Harry loudly, &#8220;give it twoweeks and Norbert&#8217;s going to be as long as your house. Malfoycould go to Dumbledore at any moment.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid bit his lip.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I &#8212; I know I can&#8217;t keep him forever, but Ican&#8217;t jus&#8217; dump him, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry suddenly turned to Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re losing it, too,&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;I&#8217;m Ron, remember?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No &#8212; Charlie &#8212; your brother, Charlie. InRomania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charliecan take care of him and then put him back in the wild!&#8221;
