<P class=noindent>Love,</P>
<P class=noindent>Charlie</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P class=noindent>They looked at one another.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the Invisibility Cloak,&#8221; saidHarry. &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult &#8212; I thinkthe cloak&#8217;s big enough to cover two of us andNorbert.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the othertwo agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert &#8212; andMalfoy.</P>
<P class=break>There was a hitch. By the next morning,Ron&#8217;s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. Hedidn&#8217;t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey&#8212; would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon,though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade ofgreen. It looked as if Norbert&#8217;s fangs were poisonous.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end ofthe day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just my hand,&#8221; he whispered,&#8220;although that feels like it&#8217;s about to fall off.Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so hecould come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tellher what really bit me &#8212; I&#8217;ve told her it was a dog,but I don&#8217;t think she believes me &#8212; I shouldn&#8217;thave hit him at the Quidditch match, that&#8217;s why he&#8217;sdoing this.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,&#8221;said Hermione, but this didn&#8217;t soothe Ron at all. On thecontrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Midnight on Saturday!&#8221; he said in a hoarse voice.&#8220;Oh no &#8212; oh no &#8212; I&#8217;ve just remembered&#8212; Charlie&#8217;s letter was in that book Malfoy took,he&#8217;s going to know we&#8217;re getting rid ofNorbert.&#8221;
