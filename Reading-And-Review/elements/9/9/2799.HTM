<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Only Ron stood by him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred andGeorge have lost loads of points in all the time they&#8217;ve beenhere, and people still like them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;ve never lost a hundred and fifty points inone go, though, have they?&#8221; said Harry miserably.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well &#8212; no,&#8221; Ron admitted.</P>
<P id=HP01CH15M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a bit late to repair thedamage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things thatweren&#8217;t his business from now on. He&#8217;d had it withsneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that hewent to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Resign?&#8221;</I> Wood thundered. &#8220;Whatgood&#8217;ll that do? How are we going to get any points back ifwe can&#8217;t win at Quidditch?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the teamwouldn&#8217;t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had tospeak about him, they called him &#8220;the Seeker.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn&#8217;t haveas bad a time as Harry, because they weren&#8217;t as well-known,but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stoppeddrawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down andworking in silence.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was almost glad that the exams weren&#8217;t far away. Allthe studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron,and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night,trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learncharms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magicaldiscoveries and goblin rebellions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then, about a week before the exams were due to start,Harry&#8217;s new resolution not to interfere in anything thatdidn&#8217;t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walkingback from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebodywhimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heardQuirrell&#8217;s voice.
