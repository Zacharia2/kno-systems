<I class=calibre9>nothing</I> gives you the right towalk around school at night, especially these days, it&#8217;s verydangerous &#8212; and fifty points will be taken fromGryffindor.&#8221; 
<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Fifty?&#8221;</I> Harry gasped &#8212; they would losethe lead, the lead he&#8217;d won in the last Quidditch match.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fifty points <I class=calibre9>each,</I>&#8221; said ProfessorMcGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Professor &#8212; please &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You <I class=calibre9>can&#8217;t</I> &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me what I can and can&#8217;t do,Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I&#8217;ve never been moreashamed of Gryffindor students.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in lastplace. In one night, they&#8217;d ruined any chance Gryffindor hadhad for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had droppedout of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t sleep all night. He could hear Nevillesobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harrycouldn&#8217;t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knewNeville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happenwhen the rest of Gryffindor found out what they&#8217;d done?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses thatrecorded the House points the next day thought there&#8217;d been amistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty pointsfewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: HarryPotter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditchmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of otherstupid first years.</P>
<P id=HP01CH15M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>From being one of the most popular andadmired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated.Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone hadbeen longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harrywent, people pointed and didn&#8217;t trouble to lower their voicesas they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as hewalked past them, whistling and cheering, &#8220;Thanks Potter, weowe you one!&#8221;
