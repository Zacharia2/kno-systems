<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Hermione didn&#8217;t get a chance to answer. MadamPomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ronneeded sleep.</P>
<P class=break>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late to change the plannow,&#8221; Harry told Hermione. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t got timeto send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance toget rid of Norbert. We&#8217;ll have to risk it. And we <I class=calibre9>have</I>got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn&#8217;t know aboutthat.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandagedtail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk tothem.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you in,&#8221; he puffed.&#8220;Norbert&#8217;s at a tricky stage &#8212; nothin&#8217; Ican&#8217;t handle.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>When they told him about Charlie&#8217;s letter, his eyes filledwith tears, although that might have been because Norbert had justbitten him on the leg.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Aargh! It&#8217;s all right, he only got my boot &#8212;jus&#8217; playin&#8217;&#8212; he&#8217;s only a baby, afterall.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturdaycouldn&#8217;t come quickly enough.</P>
<P class=break>They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when thetime came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn&#8217;tbeen so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark,cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid&#8217;shut because they&#8217;d had to wait for Peeves to get out of theirway in the entrance hall, where he&#8217;d been playing tennisagainst the wall.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s got lots o&#8217; rats an&#8217; some brandyfer the journey,&#8221; said Hagrid in a muffled voice.&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve packed his teddy bear in case he getslonely.&#8221;
