<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Had Harry thought that things couldn&#8217;t have been worse? Hewas wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leadingNeville.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Harry!&#8221; Neville burst out, the moment he saw theother two. &#8220;I was trying to find you to warn you, I heardMalfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but ProfessorMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire thanNorbert as she towered over the three of them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filchsays you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It&#8217;s oneo&#8217;clock in the morning. <I class=calibre9>Explain yourselves.&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer ateacher&#8217;s question. She was staring at her slippers, as stillas a statue.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve got a good idea of what&#8217;s beengoing on,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;ttake a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy somecock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bedand into trouble. I&#8217;ve already caught him. I suppose youthink it&#8217;s funny that Longbottom here heard the story andbelieved it, too?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry caught Neville&#8217;s eye and tried to tell him withoutwords that this wasn&#8217;t true, because Neville was lookingstunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville &#8212; Harry knew whatit must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warnthem.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m disgusted,&#8221; said Professor McGonagall.&#8220;Four students out of bed in one night! I&#8217;ve neverheard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you hadmore sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant moreto you than this. All three of you will receive detentions &#8212;yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom,
