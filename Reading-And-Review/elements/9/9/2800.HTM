<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No &#8212; no &#8212; not again, please&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry movedcloser.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right &#8212; all right &#8212;&#8221; he heardQuirrell sob.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroomstraightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he wasabout to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn&#8217;t thinkQuirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell&#8217;sfootsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It wasempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfwaytoward it before he remembered what he&#8217;d promised himselfabout not meddling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All the same, he&#8217;d have gambled twelve Sorcerer&#8217;sStones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry hadjust heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step&#8212; Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ronon Astronomy. Harry told them what he&#8217;d heard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Snape&#8217;s done it, then!&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;IfQuirrell&#8217;s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s still Fluffy, though,&#8221; saidHermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Maybe Snape&#8217;s found out how to get past him withoutasking Hagrid,&#8221; said Ron, looking up at the thousands ofbooks surrounding them. &#8220;I bet there&#8217;s a book somewherein here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. Sowhat do we do, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron&#8217;s eyes,but Hermione answered before Harry could.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to Dumbledore. That&#8217;s what we should have doneages ago. If we try anything ourselves we&#8217;ll be thrown outfor sure.&#8221;
