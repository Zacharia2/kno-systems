<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Brilliant!&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;How about it,Hagrid?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl toCharlie to ask him.</P>
<P class=break>The following week dragged by. Wednesday nightfound Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, longafter everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had justchimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared outof nowhere as he pulled off Harry&#8217;s Invisibility Cloak. Hehad been down at Hagrid&#8217;s hut, helping him feed Norbert, whowas now eating dead rats by the crate.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It bit me!&#8221; he said, showing them his hand, whichwas wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going tobe able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon&#8217;sthe most horrible animal I&#8217;ve ever met, but the way Hagridgoes on about it, you&#8217;d think it was a fluffy little bunnyrabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And whenI left, he was singing it a lullaby.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was a tap on the dark window.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s Hedwig!&#8221; said Harry, hurrying to let herin. &#8220;She&#8217;ll have Charlie&#8217;s answer!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The three of them put their heads together to read the note.</P>

<P class=noindent>Dear Ron,</P>
<P class=noindent>How are you? Thanks for the letter &#8212;I&#8217;d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but itwon&#8217;t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing willbe to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming tovisit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn&#8217;t be seen carryingan illegal dragon.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest towerat midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him awaywhile it&#8217;s still dark.
