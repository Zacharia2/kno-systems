<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy&#8217;s got detention! I could sing!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; Harry advised her.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about inhis crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swoopingdown out of the darkness.</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>Charlie&#8217;s friends were a cheerylot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they&#8217;d riggedup, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helpedbuckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shookhands with the others and thanked them very much.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last, Norbert was going&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.going&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <I class=calibre9>gone.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts aslight as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon&#8212; Malfoy in detention &#8212; what could spoil theirhappiness?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. Asthey stepped into the corridor, Filch&#8217;s face loomed suddenlyout of the darkness.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, well, well,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;we<I class=calibre9>are</I> in trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They&#8217;d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of thetower.</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall&#8217;s study onthe first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word toeach other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wildcover-up stories chased each other around Harry&#8217;s brain, eachmore feeble than the last. He couldn&#8217;t see how they weregoing to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. Howcould they have been so stupid as to forget the Cloak? There was noreason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for theirbeing out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead ofnight, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which wasout-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the InvisibilityCloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.
