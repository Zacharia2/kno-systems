<P class=epubfirstparagraph>From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harryas though the teddy was having his head torn off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bye-bye, Norbert!&#8221; Hagrid sobbed, as Harry andHermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and steppedunderneath it themselves. &#8220;Mummy will never forgetyou!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, theynever knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up themarble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.Up another staircase, then another &#8212; even one ofHarry&#8217;s shortcuts didn&#8217;t make the work much easier.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nearly there!&#8221; Harry panted as they reached thecorridor beneath the tallest tower.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop thecrate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrankinto the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two peoplegrappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, hadMalfoy by the ear.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Detention!&#8221; she shouted. &#8220;And twenty pointsfrom Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how<I class=calibre9>dare</I> you &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, Professor. HarryPotter&#8217;s coming &#8212; he&#8217;s got a dragon!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on&#8212; I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>The steep spiral staircase up to thetop of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that.Not until they&#8217;d stepped out into the cold night air did theythrow off the Cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again.Hermione did a sort of jig.
