<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The pain in Harry&#8217;s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes &#8212; thank you &#8212; what was that?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The centaur didn&#8217;t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry&#8217;s forehead.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You are the Potter boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time &#8212; especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;My name is Firenze,&#8221; he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Firenze!&#8221; Bane thundered. &#8220;What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you realize who this is?&#8221; said Firenze. &#8220;This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What have you been telling him?&#8221; growled Bane. &#8220;Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ronan pawed the ground nervously. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,&#8221; he said in his gloomy voice.
