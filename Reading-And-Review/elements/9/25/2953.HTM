<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry&#8217;s robe and made a choking noise.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s your problem, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. &#8220;Should&#8217;ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Abou&#8217; time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I bin waitin&#8217; fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,&#8221; said Filch coldly, &#8220;they&#8217;re here to be punished, after all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s why yer late, is it?&#8221; said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. &#8220;Bin lecturin&#8217; them, eh? &#8217;Snot your place ter do that. Yeh&#8217;ve done yer bit, I&#8217;ll take over from here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back at dawn,&#8221; said Filch, &#8220;for what&#8217;s left of them,&#8221; he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going in that forest,&#8221; he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,&#8221; said Hagrid fiercely. &#8220;Yeh&#8217;ve done wrong an&#8217; now yeh&#8217;ve got ter pay fer it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But this is servant stuff, it&#8217;s not for students to do. I thought we&#8217;d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he&#8217;d &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; tell yer that&#8217;s how it is at Hogwarts,&#8221; Hagrid growled. &#8220;Copyin&#8217; lines! What good&#8217;s that ter anyone? Yeh&#8217;ll do summat useful or yeh&#8217;ll get out. If yeh think yer father&#8217;d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an&#8217; pack. Go on!&#8221;
