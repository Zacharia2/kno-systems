<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mars is bright tonight,&#8221; Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. &#8220;Unusually bright.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah, but I was meanin&#8217; anythin&#8217; unusual a bit nearer home,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;So yeh haven&#8217;t noticed anythin&#8217; strange?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, &#8220;The forest hides many secrets.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hullo, Bane,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;All right?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well enough. Look, I&#8217;ve jus&#8217; bin askin&#8217; Ronan, you seen anythin&#8217; odd in here lately? There&#8217;s a unicorn bin injured &#8212; would yeh know anythin&#8217; about it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mars is bright tonight,&#8221; he said simply.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; said Hagrid grumpily. &#8220;Well, if either of you do see anythin&#8217;, let me know, won&#8217;t yeh? We&#8217;ll be off, then.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said Hagrid irritably, &#8220;try an&#8217; get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin&#8217; closer&#8217;n the moon.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Are there many of them in here?&#8221; asked Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, a fair few.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they&#8217;re good enough about turnin&#8217; up if ever I want a word. They&#8217;re deep, mind, centaurs&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they know things&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. jus&#8217; don&#8217; let on much.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;D&#8217;you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?&#8221; said Harry.
