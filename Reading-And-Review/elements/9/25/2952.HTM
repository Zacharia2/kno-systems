<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I bet you&#8217;ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won&#8217;t you, eh?&#8221; he said, leering at them. &#8220;Oh yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&#8217;s just a pity they let the old punishments die out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I&#8217;ve got the chains still in my office, keep &#8217;em well oiled in case they&#8217;re ever needed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Right, off we go, and don&#8217;t think of running off, now, it&#8217;ll be worse for you if you do.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn&#8217;t be sounding so delighted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid&#8217;s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, &#8220;I suppose you think you&#8217;ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy &#8212; it&#8217;s into the forest you&#8217;re going and I&#8217;m much mistaken if you&#8217;ll all come out in one piece.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The forest?&#8221; he repeated, and he didn&#8217;t sound quite as cool as usual. &#8220;We can&#8217;t go in there at night &#8212; there&#8217;s all sorts of things in there &#8212; werewolves, I heard.&#8221;
