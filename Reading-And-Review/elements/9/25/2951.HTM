<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve got no proof!&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Quirrell&#8217;s too scared to back us up. Snape&#8217;s only got to say he doesn&#8217;t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor &#8212; who do you think they&#8217;ll believe, him or us? It&#8217;s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore&#8217;ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn&#8217;t help us if his life depended on it, he&#8217;s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he&#8217;ll think. And don&#8217;t forget, we&#8217;re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That&#8217;ll take a lot of explaining.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn&#8217;t.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If we just do a bit of poking around &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Harry flatly, &#8220;we&#8217;ve done enough poking around.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.</P>
<P class=break>The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:</P>

<P class=noindent>Your detention will take place at eleven o&#8217;clock tonight.</P>
<P class=noindent>Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.</P>

<P class=noindent>Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they&#8217;d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn&#8217;t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they&#8217;d got.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At eleven o&#8217;clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there &#8212; and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
