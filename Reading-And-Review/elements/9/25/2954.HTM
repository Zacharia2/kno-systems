<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy didn&#8217;t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right then,&#8221; said Hagrid, &#8220;now, listen carefully, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s dangerous what we&#8217;re gonna do tonight, an&#8217; I don&#8217; want no one takin&#8217; risks. Follow me over here a moment.&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH15M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; said Hagrid, &#8220;see that stuff shinin&#8217; on the ground? Silvery stuff? That&#8217;s unicorn blood. There&#8217;s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We&#8217;re gonna try an&#8217; find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?&#8221; said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; that lives in the forest that&#8217;ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;An&#8217; keep ter the path. Right, now, we&#8217;re gonna split inter two parties an&#8217; follow the trail in diff&#8217;rent directions. There&#8217;s blood all over the place, it must&#8217;ve bin staggerin&#8217; around since last night at least.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I want Fang,&#8221; said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang&#8217;s long teeth.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right, but I warn yeh, he&#8217;s a coward,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;So me, Harry, an&#8217; Hermione&#8217;ll go one way an&#8217; Draco, Neville, an&#8217; Fang&#8217;ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we&#8217;ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an&#8217; practice now &#8212; that&#8217;s it &#8212; an&#8217; if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll all come an&#8217; find yeh &#8212; so, be careful &#8212; let&#8217;s go.&#8221;
