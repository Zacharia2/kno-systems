<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?&#8221; Harry asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not fast enough,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;It&#8217;s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they&#8217;re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You all right, Hermione?&#8221; Hagrid whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217; worry, it can&#8217;t&#8217;ve gone far if it&#8217;s this badly hurt, an&#8217; then we&#8217;ll be able ter &#8212; GET BEHIND THAT TREE!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;There&#8217;s summat in here that shouldn&#8217; be.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A werewolf?&#8221; Harry suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That wasn&#8217; no werewolf an&#8217; it wasn&#8217; no unicorn, neither,&#8221; said Hagrid grimly. &#8220;Right, follow me, but careful, now.&#8221;
