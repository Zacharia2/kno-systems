<P class=epubfirstparagraph>So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look &#8212;&#8221; he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal&#8217;s side, and began to drink its blood.</P>
<P id=HP01CH15M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;AAAAAAAAAAARGH!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted &#8212; so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry &#8212; unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry &#8212; he couldn&#8217;t move for fear.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a pain like he&#8217;d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.
