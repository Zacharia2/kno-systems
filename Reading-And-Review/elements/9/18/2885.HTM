<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn&#8217;t carry on.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That Quidditch Cup&#8217;ll have our name on it this year,&#8221; said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn&#8217;t gone off chasing dragons.&#8221;</P>
<P class=break>Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he&#8217;d already been at Hogwarts two months.

Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they&#8217;d seen him make Neville&#8217;s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry&#8217;s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn&#8217;t spoken to either of them since the day Harry&#8217;s broomstick had arrived.
