<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Er &#8212; have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?&#8221; Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never at Hogwarts. We&#8217;ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That&#8217;s you. And you don&#8217;t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; unless they crack my head open.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers &#8212; I mean, they&#8217;re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Wood, &#8220;is the Golden Snitch, and it&#8217;s the most important ball of the lot. It&#8217;s very hard to catch because it&#8217;s so fast and difficult to see. It&#8217;s the Seeker&#8217;s job to catch it. You&#8217;ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team&#8217;s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That&#8217;s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages &#8212; I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s it &#8212; any questions?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We won&#8217;t practice with the Snitch yet,&#8221; said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, &#8220;it&#8217;s too dark, we might lose it. Let&#8217;s try you out with a few of these.&#8221;
