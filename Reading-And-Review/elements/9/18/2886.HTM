<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t forget that nice wrist movement we&#8217;ve been practicing!&#8221; squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. &#8220;Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too &#8212; never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said &#8216;s&#8217; instead of &#8216;f&#8217; and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it &#8212; Harry had to put it out with his hat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron, at the next table, wasn&#8217;t having much more luck.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wingardium Leviosa!&#8221; he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re saying it wrong,&#8221; Harry heard Hermione snap. &#8220;It&#8217;s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the &#8216;gar&#8217; nice and long.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You do it, then, if you&#8217;re so clever,&#8221; Ron snarled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, &#8220;Wingardium Leviosa!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, well done!&#8221; cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. &#8220;Everyone see here, Miss Granger&#8217;s done it!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder no one can stand her,&#8221; he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, &#8220;she&#8217;s a nightmare, honestly.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face &#8212; and was startled to see that she was in tears.
