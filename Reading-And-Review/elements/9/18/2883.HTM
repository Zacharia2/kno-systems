<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three Chasers, one Keeper,&#8221; said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. &#8220;And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?&#8221; He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you now,&#8221; said Wood. &#8220;Take this.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to show you what the Bludgers do,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;These two are the Bludgers.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stand back,&#8221; Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry&#8217;s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air &#8212; it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See?&#8221; Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. &#8220;The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That&#8217;s why you have two Beaters on each team &#8212; the Weasley twins are ours &#8212; it&#8217;s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So &#8212; think you&#8217;ve got all that?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,&#8221; Harry reeled off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Wood.
