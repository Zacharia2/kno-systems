<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The key&#8217;s in the lock,&#8221; Harry muttered. &#8220;We could lock it in.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Ron nervously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn&#8217;t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop &#8212; a high, petrified scream &#8212; and it was coming from the chamber they&#8217;d just chained up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s the girls&#8217; bathroom!&#8221; Harry gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Hermione!&#8221;</I> they said together.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.
