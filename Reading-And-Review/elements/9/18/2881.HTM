<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s true,&#8221; Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, &#8220;If he hadn&#8217;t stolen Neville&#8217;s Remembrall I wouldn&#8217;t be on the team.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So I suppose you think that&#8217;s a reward for breaking rules?&#8221; came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry&#8217;s hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t speaking to us?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t stop now,&#8221; said Ron, &#8220;it&#8217;s doing us so much good.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he&#8217;d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry&#8217;s bedspread.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>As seven o&#8217;clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He&#8217;d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.
