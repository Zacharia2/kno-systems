<strong><font color="blue">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone : </font></strong>

<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling &#8212; he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hey, Potter, come down!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very nice,&#8221; said Wood, his eyes glinting. &#8220;I see what McGonagall meant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you really are a natural. I&#8217;m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you&#8217;ll be joining team practice three times a week.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Wood. &#8220;Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it&#8217;s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Three Chasers,&#8221; Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This ball&#8217;s called the Quaffle,&#8221; said Wood. &#8220;The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,&#8221; Harry recited. &#8220;So &#8212; that&#8217;s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s basketball?&#8221; said Wood curiously.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Harry quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, there&#8217;s another player on each side who&#8217;s called the Keeper &#8212; I&#8217;m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.&#8221;
