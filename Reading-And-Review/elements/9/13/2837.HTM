<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t take it in. This couldn&#8217;t be true, itcouldn&#8217;t.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Snape tried to kill me!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, no, no. <I class=calibre9>I</I> tried to kill you. Your friend MissGranger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire toSnape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you.Another few seconds and I&#8217;d have got you off that broom.I&#8217;d have managed it before then if Snape hadn&#8217;t beenmuttering a countercurse, trying to save you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Snape was trying to <I class=calibre9>save</I> me?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Quirrell coolly. &#8220;Why do youthink he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to makesure I didn&#8217;t do it again. Funny, really&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.he needn&#8217;t have bothered. I couldn&#8217;t do anything withDumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape wastrying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he <I class=calibre9>did</I> make himselfunpopular&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and what a waste of time, when afterall that, I&#8217;m going to kill you tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air andwrapped themselves tightly around Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying aroundthe school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you&#8217;d seenme coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>You</I> let the troll in?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls &#8212; youmust have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking forit, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the thirdfloor to head me off &#8212; and not only did my troll fail to beatyou to death, that three-headed dog didn&#8217;t even manage tobite Snape&#8217;s leg off properly.
