<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You mean he was there in the classroom with you?&#8221;Harry gasped.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He is with me wherever I go,&#8221; said Quirrellquietly. &#8220;I met him when I traveled around the world. Afoolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about goodand evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is nogood and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seekit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Since then, I have served him faithfully,although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hardon me.&#8221; Quirrell shivered suddenly. &#8220;He does notforgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone fromGringotts, he was most displeased. He punishedme&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. decided he would have to keep a closerwatch on me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell&#8217;s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering histrip to Diagon Alley &#8212; how could he have been so stupid?He&#8217;d <I class=calibre9>seen</I> Quirrell there that very day, shaken handswith him in the Leaky Cauldron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell cursed under his breath.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is theStone <I class=calibre9>inside</I> the mirror? Should I break it?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s mind was racing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>What I want more than anything else in the world at themoment,</I> he thought<I class=calibre9>, is to find the Stone before Quirrelldoes. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it&#8212; which means I&#8217;ll see where it&#8217;s hidden! But howcan I look without Quirrell realizing what I&#8217;m up to?</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glasswithout Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were tootight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was stilltalking to himself.
