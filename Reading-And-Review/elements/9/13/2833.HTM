<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you want to stop Snape or not?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ron &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Look, if you don&#8217;t hurry up, he&#8217;ll alreadyhave the Stone!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>There was no alternative.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; Ron called, his face pale but determined.&#8220;Here I go &#8212; now, don&#8217;t hang around onceyou&#8217;ve won.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ronhard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to thefloor &#8212; Hermione screamed but stayed on her square &#8212;the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he&#8217;dbeen knocked out.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry&#8217;sfeet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the doorahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry andHermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What if he&#8217;s &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; said Harry, trying toconvince himself. &#8220;What do you reckon&#8217;snext?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had Sprout&#8217;s, that was theDevil&#8217;s Snare; Flitwick must&#8217;ve put charms on the keys;McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; thatleaves Quirrell&#8217;s spell, andSnape&#8217;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had reached another door.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right?&#8221; Harry whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry pushed it open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of thempull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flaton the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the onethey had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t have to fight thatone,&#8221; Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one ofits massive legs. &#8220;Come on, I can&#8217;t breathe.&#8221;
