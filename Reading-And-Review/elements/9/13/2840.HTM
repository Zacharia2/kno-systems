<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me,Master!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And to Harry&#8217;s horror, a voice answered, and the voiceseemed to come from Quirrell himself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Use the boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Use theboy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell rounded on Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes &#8212; Potter &#8212; come here.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.Harry got slowly to his feet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; Quirrell repeated. &#8220;Look in themirror and tell me what you see.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry walked toward him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>I must lie,</I> he thought desperately. <I class=calibre9>I must look andlie about what I see, that&#8217;s all.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funnysmell that seemed to come from Quirrell&#8217;s turban. He closedhis eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened themagain.</P>
<P id=HP01CH17M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>He saw his reflection, pale andscared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiledat him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-redstone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket &#8212; andas it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket.Somehow &#8212; incredibly &#8212; <I class=calibre9>he&#8217;d gotten theStone.</I></P>
<P id=HP01CH17M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Quirrellimpatiently. &#8220;What do you see?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry screwed up his courage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,&#8221; heinvented. &#8220;I &#8212; I&#8217;ve won the House Cup forGryffindor.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Quirrell cursed again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get out of the way,&#8221; he said. As Harry moved aside,he felt the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone against his leg. Dare he make abreak for it?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But he hadn&#8217;t walked five paces before a high voice spoke,though Quirrell wasn&#8217;t moving his lips.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He lies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Helies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter, come back here!&#8221; Quirrell shouted.&#8220;Tell me the truth! What did you just see?&#8221;
