<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stood up.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sir &#8212; Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask yousomething?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Obviously, you&#8217;ve just done so,&#8221; Dumbledoresmiled. &#8220;You may ask me one more thing, however.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What do you see when you look in the mirror?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolensocks.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry stared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;One can never have enough socks,&#8221; said Dumbledore.&#8220;Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn&#8217;t get asingle pair. People will insist on giving me books.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry thatDumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, hethought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite apersonal question.</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>D</SPAN>umbledore had convincedHarry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for therest of the Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed foldedat the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget whathe&#8217;d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn&#8217;t. Hestarted having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about hisparents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voicecackled with laughter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could driveyou mad,&#8221; said Ron, when Harry told him about thesedreams.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took adifferent view of things. She was torn between horror at the ideaof Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row(&#8220;If Filch had caught you!&#8221;), and disappointment thathe hadn&#8217;t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
