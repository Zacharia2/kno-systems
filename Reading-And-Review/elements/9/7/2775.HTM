<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had anotherreason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playingQuidditch.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usualat the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to theGryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playingchess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, somethingHarry and Ron thought was very good for her.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me for a moment,&#8221; said Ron whenHarry sat down next to him, &#8220;I need to concen &#8212;&#8221;He caught sight of Harry&#8217;s face. &#8220;What&#8217;s thematter with you? You look terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told theother two about Snape&#8217;s sudden, sinister desire to be aQuidditch referee.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t play,&#8221; said Hermione at once.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Say you&#8217;re ill,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Pretend to break your leg,&#8221; Hermione suggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Really</I> break your leg,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Thereisn&#8217;t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can&#8217;tplay at all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he hadmanaged to climb through the portrait hole was anyone&#8217;sguess, because his legs had been stuck together with what theyrecognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had tobunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up andperformed the countercurse. Neville&#8217;s legs sprang apart andhe got to his feet, trembling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Hermione asked him, leading himover to sit with Harry and Ron.
