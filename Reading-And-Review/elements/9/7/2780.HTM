<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen Snape look so mean,&#8221; he toldHermione. &#8220;Look &#8212; they&#8217;re off. Ouch!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It wasMalfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn&#8217;t see youthere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wonder how long Potter&#8217;s going to stay on his broomthis time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron didn&#8217;t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff apenalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione,who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedlyat Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for theSnitch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know how I think they choose people for theGryffindor team?&#8221; said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, asSnape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.&#8220;It&#8217;s people they feel sorry for. See, there&#8217;sPotter, who&#8217;s got no parents, then there&#8217;s theWeasleys, who&#8217;ve got no money &#8212; you should be on theteam, Longbottom, you&#8217;ve got no brains.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to faceMalfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,&#8221; hestammered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, stillnot daring to take his eyes from the game, said, &#8220;You tellhim, Neville.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Longbottom, if brains were gold you&#8217;d be poorerthan Weasley, and that&#8217;s saying something.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron&#8217;s nerves were already stretched to the breaking pointwith anxiety about Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m warning you, Malfoy &#8212; one more word&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ron!&#8221; said Hermione suddenly, &#8220;Harry &#8212;!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What? Where?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drewgasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossedfingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like abullet.
