<P class=noindent>&#8220;See?&#8221; said Hermione, when Harryand Ron had finished. &#8220;The dog must be guardingFlamel&#8217;s Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore tokeep it safe for him, because they&#8217;re friends and he knewsomeone was after it, that&#8217;s why he wanted the Stone movedout of Gringotts!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A stone that makes gold and stops you from everdying!&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;No wonder Snape&#8217;s after it!<I class=calibre9>Anyone</I> would want it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And no wonder we couldn&#8217;t find Flamel in that<I class=calibre9>Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,</I>&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;He&#8217;s not exactly recent if he&#8217;s six hundred andsixty-five, is he?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH13M01E class=break>The next morning inDefense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways oftreating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing whatthey&#8217;d do with a Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone if they had one. Itwasn&#8217;t until Ron said he&#8217;d buy his own Quidditch teamthat Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to play,&#8221; he told Ron and Hermione.&#8220;If I don&#8217;t, all the Slytherins will think I&#8217;mjust too scared to face Snape. I&#8217;ll showthem&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#8217;ll really wipe the smiles offtheir faces if we win.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just as long as we&#8217;re not wiping you off thefield,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=break>As the match drew nearer, however, Harry becamemore and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The restof the team wasn&#8217;t too calm, either. The idea of overtakingSlytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had doneit for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such abiased referee?</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry didn&#8217;t know whether he was imagining it or not, buthe seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, heeven wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch himon his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weeklytorture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly knowthey&#8217;d found out about the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone? Harrydidn&#8217;t see how he could &#8212; yet he sometimes had thehorrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
