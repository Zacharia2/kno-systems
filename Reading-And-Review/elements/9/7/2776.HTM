<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy,&#8221; said Neville shakily. &#8220;I met himoutside the library. He said he&#8217;d been looking for someone topractice that on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go to Professor McGonagall!&#8221; Hermione urgedNeville. &#8220;Report him!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville shook his head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want more trouble,&#8221; he mumbled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to stand up to him, Neville!&#8221; saidRon. &#8220;He&#8217;s used to walking all over people, butthat&#8217;s no reason to lie down in front of him and make iteasier.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to tell me I&#8217;m not braveenough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy&#8217;s already donethat,&#8221; Neville choked out.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a ChocolateFrog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him forChristmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he mightcry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re worth twelve of Malfoy,&#8221; Harry said.&#8220;The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn&#8217;t it?And where&#8217;s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neville&#8217;s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrappedthe frog.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thanks, Harry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think I&#8217;ll goto bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. D&#8217;you want the card, you collectthem, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH13M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>As Neville walked away, Harry lookedat the Famous Wizard card.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dumbledore again,&#8221; he said, &#8220;He was the firstone I ever &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked upat Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found him!&#8221;</I> he whispered.&#8220;I&#8217;ve found Flamel! I <I class=calibre9>told</I> you I&#8217;d readthe name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here&#8212; listen to this: &#8216;Dumbledore is particularly famousfor his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for thediscovery of the twelve uses of dragon&#8217;s blood,
