<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn&#8217;t looked so excitedsince they&#8217;d gotten back the marks for their very first pieceof homework.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Stay there!&#8221; she said, and she sprinted up thestairs to the girls&#8217; dormitories. Harry and Ron barely hadtime to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, anenormous old book in her arms.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I never thought to look in here!&#8221; she whisperedexcitedly. &#8220;I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bitof light reading.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Light?&#8221;</I> said Ron, but Hermione told him tobe quiet until she&#8217;d looked something up, and startedflicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At last she found what she was looking for.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I knew it! I <I class=calibre9>knew</I> it!&#8221;</P>

<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nicolas Flamel,&#8221; she whispered dramatically,&#8220;is the <I class=calibre9>only known maker of the Sorcerer&#8217;sStone</I>!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>This didn&#8217;t have quite the effect she&#8217;dexpected.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The what?&#8221; said Harry and Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, <I class=calibre9>honestly,</I> don&#8217;t you two read? Look&#8212; read that, there.&#8221;</P>
