<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in alibrary book, even though Harry was still sure he&#8217;d read thename somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimmingthrough books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had evenless time than the other two, because Quidditch practice hadstarted again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endlessrain that had replaced the snow couldn&#8217;t dampen his spirits.The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harrywas on Wood&#8217;s side. If they won their next match, againstHufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championshipfor the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win,Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired outafter training.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session,Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He&#8217;d just gotten veryangry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other andpretending to fall off their brooms.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Will you stop messing around!&#8221; he yelled.&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing that&#8217;ll lose usthe match! Snape&#8217;s refereeing this time, and he&#8217;ll belooking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Snape&#8217;s</I> refereeing?&#8221; he splutteredthrough a mouthful of mud. &#8220;When&#8217;s he ever refereed aQuidditch match? He&#8217;s not going to be fair if we mightovertake Slytherin.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s not <I class=calibre9>my</I> fault,&#8221; said Wood.&#8220;We&#8217;ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, soSnape hasn&#8217;t got an excuse to pick on us.&#8221;
