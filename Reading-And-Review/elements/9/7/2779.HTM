<P></P>
<P class=break>Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outsidethe locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione werewondering whether they&#8217;d ever see him alive again. Thiswasn&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call comforting. Harry hardly heard aword of Wood&#8217;s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robesand picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the standsnext to Neville, who couldn&#8217;t understand why they looked sogrim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to thematch. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had beensecretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They&#8217;d gotten theidea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it onSnape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t forget, it&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>LocomotorMortis,</I>&#8221; Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up hissleeve.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I <I class=calibre9>know,</I>&#8221; Ron snapped. &#8220;Don&#8217;tnag.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we everneed an early capture of the Snitch it&#8217;s now. Finish the gamebefore Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The whole school&#8217;s out there!&#8221; said FredWeasley, peering out of the door. &#8220;Even &#8212; blimey&#8212; Dumbledore&#8217;s come to watch!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry&#8217;s heart did a somersault.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Dumbledore?&#8221;</I> he said, dashing to the door tomake sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silverbeard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe.There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him ifDumbledore was watching.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teamsmarched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.
