<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to siton the floor with Harry, &#8220;you, like hundreds before you, havediscovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was called that, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But I expect you&#8217;ve realized by now what itdoes?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It &#8212; well &#8212; it shows me my family&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And it showed your friend Ron himself as HeadBoy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How did you know &#8212; ?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need a cloak to become invisible,&#8221;said Dumbledore gently. &#8220;Now, can you think what the Mirrorof Erised shows us all?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry shook his head.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be ableto use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he wouldlook into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does thathelp?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry thought. Then he said slowly, &#8220;It shows us what wewant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever wewant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes and no,&#8221; said Dumbledore quietly. &#8220;Itshows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperatedesire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, seethem standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always beenovershadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the bestof all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledgeor truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what theyhave seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is realor even possible.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry,and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever <I class=calibre9>do</I>run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell ondreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don&#8217;t youput that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?&#8221;
