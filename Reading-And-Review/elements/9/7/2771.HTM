<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t safe &#8212; she might have gone forFilch, I bet she heard us. Come on.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.</P>
<P class=break>The snow still hadn&#8217;t melted the nextmorning.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Want to play chess, Harry?&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go down and visit Hagrid?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yougo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re thinking about, Harry, thatmirror. Don&#8217;t go back tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I dunno, I&#8217;ve just got a bad feeling about it&#8212; and anyway, you&#8217;ve had too many close shaves already.Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if theycan&#8217;t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knocksomething over?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You sound like Hermione.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m serious, Harry, don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to getback in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn&#8217;t going to stophim.</P>
<P class=break>That third night he found his way more quicklythan before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making morenoise than was wise, but he didn&#8217;t meet anyone.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, andone of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit onthe floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop himfrom staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Except &#8212;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So &#8212; back again, Harry?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He lookedbehind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none otherthan Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, sodesperate to get to the mirror he hadn&#8217;t noticed him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I &#8212; I didn&#8217;t see you, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Strange how nearsighted being invisible can makeyou,&#8221; said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that hewas smiling.
