<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up, both of you!&#8221; said Harry sharply. &#8220;Iheard something.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a sort of snuffling.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Mrs. Norris?&#8221; breathed Ron, squinting through thedark.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It wasn&#8217;t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up onthe floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they creptnearer.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Thank goodness you found me! I&#8217;ve been out here forhours, I couldn&#8217;t remember the new password to get in tobed.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Keep your voice down, Neville. The password&#8217;s&#8216;Pig snout&#8217; but it won&#8217;t help you now, the FatLady&#8217;s gone off somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How&#8217;s your arm?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Neville, showing them. &#8220;MadamPomfrey mended it in about a minute.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good &#8212; well, look, Neville, we&#8217;ve got to besomewhere, we&#8217;ll see you later &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me!&#8221; said Neville, scrambling tohis feet, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to stay here alone, the BloodyBaron&#8217;s been past twice already.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermioneand Neville.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;If either of you get us caught, I&#8217;ll never restuntil I&#8217;ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told usabout, and used it on you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how touse the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quietand beckoned them all forward.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight fromthe high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch orMrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to thethird floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy and Crabbe weren&#8217;t thereyet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caughtthem. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold inthe darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on thedoors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in caseMalfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.
