<P class=epubfirstparagraph>As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual,everyone&#8217;s attention was caught at once by a long, thinpackage carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just asinterested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right infront of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardlyfluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on topof the parcel.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because itsaid:</P>

<P class=noindent>Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as hehanded the note to Ron to read.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A Nimbus Two Thousand!&#8221; Ron moaned enviously.&#8220;I&#8217;ve never even <I class=calibre9>touched</I> one.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick inprivate before their first class, but halfway across the entrancehall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoyseized the package from Harry and felt it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s a broomstick,&#8221; he said, throwing itback to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.&#8220;You&#8217;ll be in for it this time, Potter, first yearsaren&#8217;t allowed them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron couldn&#8217;t resist it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s not any old broomstick,&#8221; he said,&#8220;it&#8217;s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you sayyou&#8217;ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?&#8221; Rongrinned at Harry. &#8220;Comets look flashy, but they&#8217;re notin the same league as the Nimbus.&#8221;
