<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pinkbathrobe and a frown.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;You!&#8221;</I> said Ron furiously. &#8220;Go back tobed!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I almost told your brother,&#8221; Hermione snapped,&#8220;Percy &#8212; he&#8217;s a prefect, he&#8217;d put a stop tothis.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry couldn&#8217;t believe anyone could be so interfering.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said to Ron. He pushed open theportrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione wasn&#8217;t going to give up that easily. She followedRon through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angrygoose.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you <I class=calibre9>care</I> about Gryffindor, do you<I class=calibre9>only</I> care about yourselves, <I class=calibre9>I</I> don&#8217;t wantSlytherin to win the House Cup, and you&#8217;ll lose all thepoints I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about SwitchingSpells.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Go away.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right, but I warned you, you just remember what Isaid when you&#8217;re on the train home tomorrow, you&#8217;re so&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But what they were, they didn&#8217;t find out. Hermione hadturned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and foundherself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on anighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of GryffindorTower.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now what am I going to do?&#8221; she asked shrilly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s your problem,&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go, we&#8217;re going to belate.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They hadn&#8217;t even reached the end of the corridor whenHermione caught up with them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming with you,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You are <I class=calibre9>not.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;D&#8217;you think I&#8217;m going to stand out here andwait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I&#8217;lltell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can backme up.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got some nerve &#8212;&#8221; said Ronloudly.
