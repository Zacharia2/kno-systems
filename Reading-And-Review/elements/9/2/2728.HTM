<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron stared after her, his mouth open.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, we don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; he said.&#8220;You&#8217;d think we dragged her along, wouldn&#8217;tyou?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as heclimbed back into bed. The dog was guardingsomething.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What had Hagrid said? Gringotts wasthe safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide&#8212; except perhaps Hogwarts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littlepackage from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>M</SPAN>alfoy couldn&#8217;tbelieve his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still atHogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting thethree-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they werequite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ronin about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringottsto Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what couldpossibly need such heavy protection.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s either really valuable or reallydangerous,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Or both,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object wasthat it was about two inches long, they didn&#8217;t have muchchance of guessing what it was without further clues.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest inwhat lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville caredabout was never going near the dog again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she wassuch a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. Allthey really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and totheir great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about aweek later.
