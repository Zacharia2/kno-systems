<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I &#8212; <I class=calibre9>told</I> &#8212; you,&#8221; Hermionegasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, &#8220;I &#8212; told&#8212; you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,&#8221;said Ron, &#8220;quickly as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Malfoy tricked you,&#8221; Hermione said to Harry.&#8220;You realize that, don&#8217;t you? He was never going tomeet you &#8212; Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophyroom, Malfoy must have tipped him off.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn&#8217;t goingto tell her that.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It wasn&#8217;t going to be that simple. They hadn&#8217;t gonemore than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something cameshooting out of a classroom in front of them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal ofdelight.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up, Peeves &#8212; please &#8212; you&#8217;ll getus thrown out.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Peeves cackled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut,tut. Naughty, naughty, you&#8217;ll get caughty.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not if you don&#8217;t give us away, Peeves,please.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Should tell Filch, I should,&#8221; said Peeves in asaintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. &#8220;It&#8217;sfor your own good, you know.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Get out of the way,&#8221; snapped Ron, taking a swipe atPeeves &#8212; this was a big mistake.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;STUDENTS OUT OF BED!&#8221; Peeves bellowed,&#8220;STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!&#8221;</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M03S class=epubfirstparagraph>Ducking under Peeves, they ran fortheir lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammedinto a door &#8212; and it was locked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This is it!&#8221; Ron moaned, as they pushed helplesslyat the door, &#8220;We&#8217;re done for! This is theend!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he couldtoward Peeves&#8217;s shouts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, move over,&#8221; Hermione snarled. She grabbedHarry&#8217;s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered,
