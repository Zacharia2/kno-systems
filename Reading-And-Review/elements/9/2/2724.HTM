<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s late, maybe he&#8217;s chickened out,&#8221;Ron whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had onlyjust raised his wand when they heard someone speak &#8212; and itwasn&#8217;t Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in acorner.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry wavedmadly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; theyscurried silently toward the door, away from Filch&#8217;s voice.Neville&#8217;s robes had barely whipped round the corner when theyheard Filch enter the trophy room.</P>
<P id=HP01CH09M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;They&#8217;re in heresomewhere,&#8221; they heard him mutter, &#8220;probablyhiding.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;This way!&#8221; Harry mouthed to the others and,petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits ofarmor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly letout a frightened squeak and broke into a run &#8212; he tripped,grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled rightinto a suit of armor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the wholecastle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;RUN!&#8221; Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinteddown the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch wasfollowing &#8212; they swung around the doorpost and galloped downone corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any ideawhere they were or where they were going &#8212; they rippedthrough a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway,hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, whichthey knew was miles from the trophy room.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve lost him,&#8221; Harry panted,leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville wasbent double, wheezing and spluttering.
