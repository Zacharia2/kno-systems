<P id=HP01CH09M03E class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry groped for the doorknob &#8212;between Filch and death, he&#8217;d take Filch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They fell backward &#8212; Harry slammed the door shut, and theyran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must havehurried off to look for them somewhere else, because theydidn&#8217;t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared &#8212; allthey wanted to do was put as much space as possible between themand that monster. They didn&#8217;t stop running until they reachedthe portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where on earth have you all been?&#8221; she asked,looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and theirflushed, sweaty faces.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never mind that &#8212; pig snout, pig snout,&#8221;panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled intothe common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville,indeed, looked as if he&#8217;d never speak again.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What do they think they&#8217;re doing, keeping a thinglike that locked up in a school?&#8221; said Ron finally. &#8220;Ifany dog needs exercise, that one does.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper backagain.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t use your eyes, any of you, do you?&#8221;she snapped. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see what it was standingon?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The floor?&#8221; Harry suggested. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;tlooking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;No, <I class=calibre9>not</I> the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor.It&#8217;s obviously guarding something.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She stood up, glaring at them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re pleased with yourselves. We could allhave been killed &#8212; or worse, expelled. Now, if youdon&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to bed.&#8221;
