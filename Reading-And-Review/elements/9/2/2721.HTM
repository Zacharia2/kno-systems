<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And what if I wave my wand and nothinghappens?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Throw it away and punch him on the nose,&#8221; Ronsuggested.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t a person eat in peace in this place?&#8221;said Ron.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help overhearing what you and Malfoywere saying &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bet you could,&#8221; Ron muttered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; and you <I class=calibre9>mustn&#8217;t</I> go wandering aroundthe school at night, think of the points you&#8217;ll loseGryffindor if you&#8217;re caught, and you&#8217;re bound to be.It&#8217;s really very selfish of you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And it&#8217;s really none of your business,&#8221; saidHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Ron.</P>
<P class=break>All the same, it wasn&#8217;t what you&#8217;dcall the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awakemuch later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Nevillewasn&#8217;t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent allevening giving him advice such as &#8220;If he tries to curse you,you&#8217;d better dodge it, because I can&#8217;t remember how toblock them.&#8221; There was a very good chance they were going toget caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushinghis luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand,Malfoy&#8217;s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness&#8212; this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. Hecouldn&#8217;t miss it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Half-past eleven,&#8221; Ron muttered at last,&#8220;we&#8217;d better go.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and creptacross the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into theGryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in thefireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke fromthe chair nearest them, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;regoing to do this, Harry.&#8221;
