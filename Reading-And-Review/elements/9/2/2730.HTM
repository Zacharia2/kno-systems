<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn&#8217;tafford half the handle,&#8221; Malfoy snapped back. &#8220;Isuppose you and your brothers have to save up twig bytwig.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared atMalfoy&#8217;s elbow.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not arguing, I hope, boys?&#8221; he squeaked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Potter&#8217;s been sent a broomstick, Professor,&#8221;said Malfoy quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, yes, that&#8217;s right,&#8221; said ProfessorFlitwick, beaming at Harry. &#8220;Professor McGonagall told me allabout the special circumstances, Potter. And what model isit?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,&#8221; said Harry, fightingnot to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy&#8217;s face.&#8220;And it&#8217;s really thanks to Malfoy here that I&#8217;vegot it,&#8221; he added.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter atMalfoy&#8217;s obvious rage and confusion.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s true,&#8221; Harry chortled as theyreached the top of the marble staircase, &#8220;If he hadn&#8217;tstolen Neville&#8217;s Remembrall I wouldn&#8217;t be on theteam.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So I suppose you think that&#8217;s a reward for breakingrules?&#8221; came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermionewas stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the packagein Harry&#8217;s hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t speaking to us?&#8221; saidHarry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t stop now,&#8221; said Ron,&#8220;it&#8217;s doing us so much good.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.</P>
<P id=HP01CH10M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had a lot of trouble keeping hismind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitorywhere his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying offto the Quidditch field where he&#8217;d be learning to play thatnight. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what hewas eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the NimbusTwo Thousand at last.
