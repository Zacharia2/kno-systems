<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The lock clicked and the door swung open &#8212; they piledthrough it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it,listening.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Which way did they go, Peeves?&#8221; Filch was saying.&#8220;Quick, tell me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Say &#8216;please.&#8217;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mess with me, Peeves, now <I class=calibre9>where did theygo</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t say nothing if you don&#8217;t sayplease,&#8221; said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;All right &#8212; <I class=calibre9>please.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn&#8217;t say nothingif you didn&#8217;t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!&#8221; And theyheard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing inrage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He thinks this door is locked,&#8221; Harry whispered.&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be okay &#8212; get <I class=calibre9>off,</I>Neville!&#8221; For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve ofHarry&#8217;s bathrobe for the last minute.<I class=calibre9>&#8220;What?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry turned around &#8212; and saw, quite clearly, what. For amoment, he was sure he&#8217;d walked into a nightmare &#8212; thiswas too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They weren&#8217;t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in acorridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now theyknew why it was forbidden.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, adog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It hadthree heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses,twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths,saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, andHarry knew that the only reason they weren&#8217;t already dead wasthat their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it wasquickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what thosethunderous growls meant.
