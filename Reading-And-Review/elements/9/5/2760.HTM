<P class=epubfirstparagraph>On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the nextday for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents atall. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing hesaw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Merry Christmas,&#8221; said Ron sleepily as Harryscrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You, too,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Will you look atthis? I&#8217;ve got some presents!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What did you expect, turnips?&#8221; said Ron, turning tohis own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry&#8217;s.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brownpaper and scrawled across it was <I class=calibre9>To Harry, from Hagrid.</I>Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviouslywhittled it himself. Harry blew it &#8212; it sounded a bit like anowl.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A second, very small parcel contained a note.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>We received your message and enclose your Christmas present.From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.</I> Taped to the note was afifty-pence piece.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;That&#8217;s friendly,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;<I class=calibre9>Weird!</I>&#8221; he said, &#8220;What a shape! Thisis <I class=calibre9>money</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You can keep it,&#8221; said Harry, laughing at howpleased Ron was. &#8220;Hagrid and my aunt and uncle &#8212; so whosent these?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I think I know who that one&#8217;s from,&#8221; saidRon, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.&#8220;My mum. I told her you didn&#8217;t expect any presents and&#8212; oh, no,&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;she&#8217;s made you aWeasley sweater.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knittedsweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
