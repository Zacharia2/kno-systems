<P id=HP01CH12M01E class=epubfirstparagraph>Five minutes later, Ron and Hermionejoined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You will keep looking while I&#8217;m away, won&#8217;tyou?&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;And send me an owl if you findanything.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamelis,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;It&#8217;d be safe to askthem.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very safe, as they&#8217;re both dentists,&#8221; saidHermione.</P>
<P class=break>Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry werehaving too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had thedormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier thanusual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toastingfork &#8212; bread, English muffins, marshmallows &#8212; andplotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talkabout even if they wouldn&#8217;t work.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactlylike Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made ita lot like directing troops in battle. Ron&#8217;s set was very oldand battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belongedto someone else in his family &#8212; in this case, hisgrandfather. However, old chessmen weren&#8217;t a drawback at all.Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do whathe wanted.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, andthey didn&#8217;t trust him at all. He wasn&#8217;t a very goodplayer yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him,which was confusing. &#8220;Don&#8217;t send me there, can&#8217;tyou see his knight? Send <I class=calibre9>him,</I> we can afford to lose
