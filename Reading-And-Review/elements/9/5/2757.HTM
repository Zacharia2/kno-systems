<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah, Hagrid, the last tree &#8212; put it in the farcorner, would you?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoehung all around the walls, and no less than twelve toweringChristmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tinyicicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How many days you got left until yer holidays?&#8221;Hagrid asked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just one,&#8221; said Hermione. &#8220;And that remindsme &#8212; Harry, Ron, we&#8217;ve got half an hour before lunch,we should be in the library.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh yeah, you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Ron, tearing hiseyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubblesblossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branchesof the new tree.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The library?&#8221; said Hagrid, following them out ofthe hall. &#8220;Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren&#8217;tyeh?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not working,&#8221; Harry told himbrightly. &#8220;Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamelwe&#8217;ve been trying to find out who he is.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You <I class=calibre9>what</I>?&#8221; Hagrid looked shocked.&#8220;Listen here &#8212; I&#8217;ve told yeh &#8212; drop it.It&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to you what that dog&#8217;sguardin&#8217;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that&#8217;sall,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Unless you&#8217;d like to tell us and save us thetrouble?&#8221; Harry added. &#8220;We must&#8217;ve been throughhundreds of books already and we can&#8217;t find him anywhere&#8212; just give us a hint &#8212; I know I&#8217;ve read his namesomewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said Hagridflatly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just have to find out for ourselves, then,&#8221; saidRon, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off tothe library.</P>
<P id=HP01CH12M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>They had indeed been searching booksfor Flamel&#8217;s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, becausehow else were they going to find out what Snape was trying tosteal?
