<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid dropped the teapot.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;How do you know about Fluffy?&#8221; he said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Fluffy?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; he&#8217;s mine &#8212; bought him off aGreek chappie I met in the pub las&#8217; year &#8212; I lent himto Dumbledore to guard the &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Harry eagerly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t ask me anymore,&#8221; said Hagridgruffly. &#8220;That&#8217;s top secret, that is.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But Snape&#8217;s trying to <I class=calibre9>steal</I> it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; said Hagrid again. &#8220;Snape&#8217;s aHogwarts teacher, he&#8217;d do nothin&#8217; of thesort.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So why did he just try and kill Harry?&#8221; criedHermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The afternoon&#8217;s events certainly seemed to have changedher mind about Snape.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I&#8217;ve read allabout them! You&#8217;ve got to keep eye contact, and Snapewasn&#8217;t blinking at all, I saw him!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; yeh, yer wrong!&#8221; saidHagrid hotly. &#8220;I don&#8217; know why Harry&#8217;s broomacted like that, but Snape wouldn&#8217; try an&#8217; kill astudent! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh &#8212; yermeddlin&#8217; in things that don&#8217; concern yeh. It&#8217;sdangerous. You forget that dog, an&#8217; you forget whatit&#8217;s guardin&#8217;, that&#8217;s between ProfessorDumbledore an&#8217; Nicolas Flamel &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;so there&#8217;s someonecalled Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid looked furious with himself.</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>C</SPAN>hristmas was coming.One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself coveredin several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twinswere punished for bewitching several snowballs so that theyfollowed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. Thefew owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky todeliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before theycould fly off again.
