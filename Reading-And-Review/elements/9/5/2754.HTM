<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>No one could wait for the holidays to start. While theGryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, thedrafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled thewindows in the classrooms. Worst of all were ProfessorSnape&#8217;s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rosein a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to theirhot cauldrons.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I do feel so sorry,&#8221; said Draco Malfoy, one Potionsclass, &#8220;for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts forChristmas because they&#8217;re not wanted at home.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goylechuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish,ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual sincethe Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he hadtried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frogwould be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he&#8217;d realizedthat nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed atthe way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. SoMalfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry abouthaving no proper family.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was true that Harry wasn&#8217;t going back to Privet Drivefor Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the weekbefore, making a list of students who would be staying for theholidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn&#8217;t feelsorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmashe&#8217;d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too,because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visitCharlie.
