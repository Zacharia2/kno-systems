<P class=break>They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoeson toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished whenthe owner of the hotel came over to their table.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only Igot about an &#8217;undred of these at the front desk.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>She held up a letter so they could read the green inkaddress:</P>

<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Mr. H. Potter</I></P>
<P class=noindent><I class=calibre9>Room 17</I></P>

<P class=noindent>Harry made a grab for the letter but UncleVernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them,&#8221; said Uncle Vernon, standingup quickly and following her from the dining room.</P>
<P class=break>&nbsp;&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better just togo home, dear?&#8221; Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later,but Uncle Vernon didn&#8217;t seem to hear her. Exactly what he waslooking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of aforest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in thecar, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middleof a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at thetop of a multilevel parking garage.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Daddy&#8217;s gone mad, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Dudleyasked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon hadparked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, anddisappeared.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car.Dudley sniveled.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s Monday,&#8221; he told his mother. &#8220;TheGreat Humberto&#8217;s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a<I class=calibre9>television.</I>&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it <I class=calibre9>was</I>Monday &#8212; and you could usually count on Dudley to know thedays of the week, because of television &#8212; then tomorrow,Tuesday, was Harry&#8217;s eleventh birthday. Of course, hisbirthdays were never exactly fun &#8212; last year, the Dursleyshad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon&#8217;s oldsocks. Still, you weren&#8217;t eleven every day.
