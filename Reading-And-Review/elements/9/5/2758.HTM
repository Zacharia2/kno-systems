<I class=calibre9>Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century,</I>or <I class=calibre9>Notable Magical Names of Our Time;</I> he was missing, too,from <I class=calibre9>Important Modern Magical Discoveries,</I> and <I class=calibre9>A Study ofRecent Developments in Wizardry.</I> And then, of course, there wasthe sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books;thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. 
<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decidedto search while Ron strode off down a row of books and startedpulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to theRestricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamelwasn&#8217;t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed aspecially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any ofthe restricted books, and he knew he&#8217;d never get one. Thesewere the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught atHogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced DefenseAgainst the Dark Arts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you looking for, boy?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster athim.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;d better get out, then. Go on &#8212;out!&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Wishing he&#8217;d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story,Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreedthey&#8217;d better not ask Madam Pince where they could findFlamel. They were sure she&#8217;d be able to tell them, but theycouldn&#8217;t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two hadfound anything, but he wasn&#8217;t very hopeful. They had beenlooking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd momentsbetween lessons it wasn&#8217;t surprising they&#8217;d foundnothing. What they really needed was a nice long search withoutMadam Pince breathing down their necks.
