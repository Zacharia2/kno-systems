<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?&#8221;Seamus whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t have,&#8221; Hagrid said, his voice shaking.&#8220;Can&#8217;t nothing interfere with a broomstick exceptpowerful Dark magic &#8212; no kid could do that to a Nimbus TwoThousand.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid&#8217;s binoculars, butinstead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically atthe crowd.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; moaned Ron, gray-faced.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; Hermione gasped, &#8220;Snape &#8212;look.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of thestands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and wasmuttering nonstop under his breath.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He&#8217;s doing something &#8212; jinxing thebroom,&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What should we do?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Leave it to me.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ronturned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating sohard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. Thewhole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleysflew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, butit was no good &#8212; every time they got near him, the broomwould jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneathhim, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seizedthe Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on, Hermione,&#8221; Ron muttered desperately.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snapestood, and was now racing along the row behind him; shedidn&#8217;t even stop to say sorry as she knocked ProfessorQuirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, shecrouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few,well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto thehem of Snape&#8217;s robes.
