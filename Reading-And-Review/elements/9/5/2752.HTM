<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he wason fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping thefire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled backalong the row &#8212; Snape would never know what had happened.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamberback on to his broom.</P>
<P id=HP01CH11M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Neville, you can look!&#8221;Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid&#8217;s jacket forthe last five minutes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him claphis hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick &#8212; hehit the field on all fours &#8212; coughed &#8212; and somethinggold fell into his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the Snitch!&#8221; he shouted, waving itabove his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t <I class=calibre9>catch</I> it, he nearly<I class=calibre9>swallowed</I> it,&#8221; Flint was still howling twenty minuteslater, but it made no difference &#8212; Harry hadn&#8217;t brokenany rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results&#8212; Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points tosixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup ofstrong tea back in Hagrid&#8217;s hut, with Ron and Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It was Snape,&#8221; Ron was explaining, &#8220;Hermioneand I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, hewouldn&#8217;t take his eyes off you.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; said Hagrid, who hadn&#8217;t heard aword of what had gone on next to him in the stands. &#8220;Whywould Snape do somethin&#8217; like that?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering whatto tell him. Harry decided on the truth.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I found out something about him,&#8221; he told Hagrid.&#8220;He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. Itbit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it&#8217;sguarding.&#8221;
