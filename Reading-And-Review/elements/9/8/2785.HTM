<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hermione, the exams are ages away.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ten weeks,&#8221; Hermione snapped. &#8220;That&#8217;snot ages, that&#8217;s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not six hundred years old,&#8221; Ronreminded her. &#8220;Anyway, what are you studying for, you alreadyknow it all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize weneed to pass these exams to get into the second year? They&#8217;revery important, I should have started studying a month ago, Idon&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gotten intome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the samelines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that theEaster holidays weren&#8217;t nearly as much fun as the Christmasones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting thetwelve uses of dragon&#8217;s blood or practicing wand movements.Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time inthe library with her, trying to get through all their extrawork.</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never rememberthis,&#8221; Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quilland looking longingly out of the library window. It was the firstreally fine day they&#8217;d had in months. The sky was a clear,forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summercoming.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, who was looking up &#8220;Dittany&#8221; in <I class=calibre9>OneThousand Magical Herbs and Fungi,</I> didn&#8217;t look up until heheard Ron say, &#8220;Hagrid! What are you doing in thelibrary?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. Helooked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Jus&#8217; lookin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, in a shiftyvoice that got their interest at once. &#8220;An&#8217;what&#8217;re you lot up ter?&#8221; He looked suddenly suspicious.&#8220;Yer not still lookin&#8217; fer Nicolas Flamel, areyeh?&#8221;
