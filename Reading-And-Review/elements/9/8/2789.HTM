<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Won it,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Las&#8217; night. Iwas down in the village havin&#8217; a few drinks an&#8217; gotinto a game o&#8217; cards with a stranger. Think he was quite gladter get rid of it, ter be honest.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what are you going to do with it when it&#8217;shatched?&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve bin doin&#8217; somereadin&#8217;,&#8221; said Hagrid, pulling a large book from underhis pillow. &#8220;Got this outta the library &#8212; <I class=calibre9>DragonBreeding for Pleasure and Profit</I> &#8212; it&#8217;s a bit outtadate, o&#8217; course, but it&#8217;s all in here. Keep the egg inthe fire, &#8217;cause their mothers breathe on &#8217;em, see,an&#8217; when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o&#8217; brandymixed with chicken blood every half hour. An&#8217; see here&#8212; how ter recognize diff&#8217;rent eggs &#8212; what I gotthere&#8217;s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They&#8217;re rare,them.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermionedidn&#8217;t.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid, you live in a <I class=calibre9>wooden house,</I>&#8221; shesaid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Hagrid wasn&#8217;t listening. He was humming merrily as hestoked the fire.</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M02E class=break>So now they hadsomething else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid ifanyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wonder what it&#8217;s like to have a peacefullife,&#8221; Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggledthrough all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had nowstarted making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It wasdriving them nuts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note fromHagrid. He had written only two words: <I class=calibre9>It&#8217;shatching.</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.Hermione wouldn&#8217;t hear of it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to seea dragon hatching?&#8221;
