<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But there aren&#8217;t wild dragons in<I class=calibre9>Britain</I>?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course there are,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Common WelshGreen and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushingthem up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells onMuggles who&#8217;ve spotted them, to make them forget.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So what on earth&#8217;s Hagrid up to?&#8221; saidHermione.</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M01E class=epubfirstparagraph></P>
<P id=HP01CH14M02S class=break>When they knocked on thedoor of the gamekeeper&#8217;s hut an hour later, they weresurprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; before he let them in, and then shut thedoor quickly behind them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day,there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea andoffered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So &#8212; yeh wanted to ask mesomethin&#8217;?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry. There was no point beating aroundthe bush. &#8220;We were wondering if you could tell uswhat&#8217;s guarding the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone apart fromFluffy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid frowned at him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;O&#8217; course I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Number one, I don&#8217; know meself. Number two, yeh knowtoo much already, so I wouldn&#8217; tell yeh if I could. ThatStone&#8217;s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outtaGringotts &#8212; I s&#8217;ppose yeh&#8217;ve worked that outan&#8217; all? Beats me how yeh even know abou&#8217;Fluffy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, butyou <I class=calibre9>do</I> know, you know everything that goes on roundhere,&#8221; said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice.Hagrid&#8217;s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling.&#8220;We only wondered who had <I class=calibre9>done</I> the guarding,really.&#8221; Hermione went on. &#8220;We wondered who Dumbledorehad trusted enough to help him, apart from you.&#8221;
