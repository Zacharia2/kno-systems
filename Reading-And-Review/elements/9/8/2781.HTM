<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re in luck, Weasley, Potter&#8217;s obviouslyspotted some money on the ground!&#8221; said Malfoy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was ontop of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, thenclambered over the back of his seat to help.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Come on, Harry!&#8221; Hermione screamed, leaping ontoher seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape &#8212; shedidn&#8217;t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under herseat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists thatwas Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time tosee something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches &#8212;the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raisedin triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could everremember the Snitch being caught so quickly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game&#8217;s over!Harry&#8217;s won! We&#8217;ve won! Gryffindor is in thelead!&#8221; shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat andhugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. Hecouldn&#8217;t believe it. He&#8217;d done it &#8212; the game wasover; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors camespilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced andtight-lipped &#8212; then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder andlooked up into Dumbledore&#8217;s smiling face.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; said Dumbledore quietly, so that onlyHarry could hear. &#8220;Nice to see you haven&#8217;t beenbrooding about that mirror&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. been keepingbusy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. excellent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
