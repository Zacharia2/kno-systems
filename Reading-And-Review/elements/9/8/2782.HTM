<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape spat bitterly on the ground.</P>
<P class=break>Harry left the locker room alone some time later,to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. Hecouldn&#8217;t ever remember feeling happier. He&#8217;d reallydone something to be proud of now &#8212; no one could say he wasjust a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled sosweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in hishead, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him ontotheir shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up anddown, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden doorand looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in thesetting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He&#8217;d done it, he&#8217;dshown Snape.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P id=HP01CH13M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>And speaking ofSnape&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possibletoward the forbidden forest. Harry&#8217;s victory faded from hismind as he watched. He recognized the figure&#8217;s prowling walk.Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner&#8212; what was going on?</P>
<P id=HP01CH13M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry jumped back on his Nimbus TwoThousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he sawSnape enter the forest at a run. He followed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The trees were so thick he couldn&#8217;t see where Snape hadgone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the topbranches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them andlanded noiselessly in a towering beech tree.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight tohis broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.
