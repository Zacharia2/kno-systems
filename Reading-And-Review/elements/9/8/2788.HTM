<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid&#8217;s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ronbeamed at Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217; s&#8217;pose it could hurt ter tellyeh that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let&#8217;s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.he borrowed Fluffy from me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then some o&#8217;the teachers did enchantments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Professor Sprout&#8212; Professor Flitwick &#8212; Professor McGonagall&#8212;&#8221; he ticked them off on his fingers, &#8220;ProfessorQuirrell &#8212; an&#8217; Dumbledore himself did somethin&#8217;,o&#8217; course. Hang on, I&#8217;ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah,Professor Snape.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Snape?&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; yer not still on abou&#8217; that, are yeh?Look, Snape helped <I class=calibre9>protect</I> the Stone, he&#8217;s not aboutter steal it.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. IfSnape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easyto find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably kneweverything &#8212; except, it seemed, Quirrell&#8217;s spell andhow to get past Fluffy.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one who knows how to get pastFluffy, aren&#8217;t you, Hagrid?&#8221; said Harry anxiously.&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone, would you? Not even oneof the teachers?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not a soul knows except me an&#8217; Dumbledore,&#8221;said Hagrid proudly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s something,&#8221; Harry muttered tothe others. &#8220;Hagrid, can we have a window open? I&#8217;mboiling.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, Harry, sorry,&#8221; said Hagrid. Harrynoticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid &#8212; what&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>that</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with hisbeard, &#8220;That&#8217;s &#8212;er&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where did you get it, Hagrid?&#8221; said Ron, crouchingover the fire to get a closer look at the egg. &#8220;Itmust&#8217;ve cost you a fortune.&#8221;
