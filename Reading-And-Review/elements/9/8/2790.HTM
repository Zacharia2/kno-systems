<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got lessons, we&#8217;ll get into trouble,and that&#8217;s nothing to what Hagrid&#8217;s going to be in whensomeone finds out what he&#8217;s doing &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; Harry whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead tolisten. How much had he heard? Harry didn&#8217;t like the look onMalfoy&#8217;s face at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid&#8217;s with the other twoduring morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at theend of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels atonce and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s nearly out.&#8221; He ushered them inside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it.Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming fromit.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched withbated breath.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn&#8217;t exactlypretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella.Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had along snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging,orange eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he <I class=calibre9>beautiful</I>?&#8221; Hagrid murmured.He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon&#8217;s head. It snappedat his fingers, showing pointed fangs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bless him, look, he knows his mummy!&#8221; saidHagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid,&#8221; said Hermione, &#8220;how fast doNorwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?&#8221;
