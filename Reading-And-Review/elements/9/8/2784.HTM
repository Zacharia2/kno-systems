<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never mind that now,&#8221; said Harry breathlessly.&#8220;Let&#8217;s find an empty room, you wait &#8217;til you hearthis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He made sure Peeves wasn&#8217;t inside before shutting the doorbehind them, then he told them what he&#8217;d seen and heard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So we were right, it <I class=calibre9>is</I> the Sorcerer&#8217;sStone, and Snape&#8217;s trying to force Quirrell to help him getit. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy &#8212; and he saidsomething about Quirrell&#8217;s &#8216;hocus-pocus&#8217;&#8212; Ireckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy,loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done someanti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So you mean the Stone&#8217;s only safe as long asQuirrell stands up to Snape?&#8221; said Hermione in alarm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be gone by next Tuesday,&#8221; said Ron.</P>

<P class=first><SPAN class=drop>Q</SPAN>uirrell, however, musthave been braver than they&#8217;d thought. In the weeks thatfollowed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but itdidn&#8217;t look as though he&#8217;d cracked yet.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, andHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffywas still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usualbad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe.Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him anencouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people offfor laughing at Quirrell&#8217;s stutter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione, however, had more on her mind than theSorcerer&#8217;s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedulesand color-coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn&#8217;t haveminded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.
