<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,&#8221; said Ronimpressively. &#8220;<I class=calibre9>And</I> we know what that dog&#8217;sguarding, it&#8217;s a Sorcerer&#8217;s St &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Shhhh!&#8221;</I> Hagrid looked around quickly to seeif anyone was listening. &#8220;Don&#8217; go shoutin&#8217; aboutit, what&#8217;s the matter with yeh?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matterof fact,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;about what&#8217;s guarding theStone apart from Fluffy &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;SHHHH!&#8221; said Hagrid again. &#8220;Listen &#8212;come an&#8217; see me later, I&#8217;m not promisin&#8217;I&#8217;ll tell yeh anythin&#8217;, mind, but don&#8217; gorabbitin&#8217; about it in here, students aren&#8217;s&#8217;pposed ter know. They&#8217;ll think I&#8217;ve told yeh&#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See you later, then,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid shuffled off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What was he hiding behind his back?&#8221; said Hermionethoughtfully.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you think it had anything to do with theStone?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see what section he was in,&#8221;said Ron, who&#8217;d had enough of working. He came back a minutelater with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on thetable.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph><I class=calibre9>&#8220;Dragons!&#8221;</I> he whispered. &#8220;Hagrid waslooking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: <I class=calibre9>Dragon Species ofGreat Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A DragonKeeper&#8217;s Guide.&#8221;</I></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid&#8217;s always wanted a dragon, he told me so thefirst time I ever met him,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But it&#8217;s against our laws,&#8221; said Ron.&#8220;Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks&#8217;Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It&#8217;s hard to stopMuggles from noticing us if we&#8217;re keeping dragons in the backgarden &#8212; anyway, you can&#8217;t tame dragons, it&#8217;sdangerous. You should see the burns Charlie&#8217;s got off wildones in Romania.&#8221;
