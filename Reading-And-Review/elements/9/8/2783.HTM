<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn&#8217;talone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn&#8217;t make out thelook on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harrystrained to catch what they were saying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. d-don&#8217;t know why you wanted t-t-tomeet here of all p-places, Severus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, I thought we&#8217;d keep this private,&#8221; saidSnape, his voice icy. &#8220;Students aren&#8217;t supposed to knowabout the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone, after all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snapeinterrupted him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Have you found out how to get past that beast ofHagrid&#8217;s yet?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;B-b-but Severus, I &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,&#8221;said Snape, taking a step toward him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t know what you &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know perfectly well what I mean.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. Hesteadied himself in time to hear Snape say, &#8220;&#8212; yourlittle bit of hocus-pocus. I&#8217;m waiting.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;B-but I d-d-don&#8217;t &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Snape cut in. &#8220;We&#8217;ll haveanother little chat soon, when you&#8217;ve had time to thinkthings over and decided where your loyalties lie.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standingquite still as though he was petrified.</P>
<P class=break>&#8220;Harry, where have you <I class=calibre9>been</I>?&#8221;Hermione squeaked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We won! You won! We won!&#8221; shouted Ron, thumpingHarry on the back. &#8220;And I gave Malfoy a black eye, andNeville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He&#8217;sstill out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he&#8217;ll be all right&#8212; talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone&#8217;s waiting foryou in the common room, we&#8217;re having a party, Fred and Georgestole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.&#8221;
