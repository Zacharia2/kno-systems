<strong><font color="blue">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone : </font></strong>

<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell&#8217;s stutter.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn&#8217;t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hermione, the exams are ages away.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ten weeks,&#8221; Hermione snapped. &#8220;That&#8217;s not ages, that&#8217;s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But we&#8217;re not six hundred years old,&#8221; Ron reminded her. &#8220;Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They&#8217;re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gotten into me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren&#8217;t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon&#8217;s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
