<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.</P>
<P class=break>&#8220;Harry, where have you been?&#8221; Hermione squeaked.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We won! You won! We won!&#8221; shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. &#8220;And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He&#8217;s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he&#8217;ll be all right &#8212; talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone&#8217;s waiting for you in the common room, we&#8217;re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Never mind that now,&#8221; said Harry breathlessly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s find an empty room, you wait &#8217;til you hear this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He made sure Peeves wasn&#8217;t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he&#8217;d seen and heard.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So we were right, it is the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone, and Snape&#8217;s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy &#8212; and he said something about Quirrell&#8217;s &#8216;hocus-pocus&#8217;&#8212; I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So you mean the Stone&#8217;s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?&#8221; said Hermione in alarm.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be gone by next Tuesday,&#8221; said Ron.</P>

<P class=first>Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they&#8217;d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn&#8217;t look as though he&#8217;d cracked yet.
