<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;It&#8217;s nearly out.&#8221; He ushered them inside.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn&#8217;t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he beautiful?&#8221; Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon&#8217;s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Bless him, look, he knows his mummy!&#8221; said Hagrid.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid,&#8221; said Hermione, &#8220;how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face &#8212; he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Someone was lookin&#8217; through the gap in the curtains &#8212; it&#8217;s a kid &#8212; he&#8217;s runnin&#8217; back up ter the school.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy had seen the dragon.</P>
<P class=break>Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy&#8217;s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid&#8217;s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Just let him go,&#8221; Harry urged. &#8220;Set him free.&#8221;
