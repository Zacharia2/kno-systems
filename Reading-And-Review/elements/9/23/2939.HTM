<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn&#8217;t.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But Hagrid wasn&#8217;t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.</P>
<P id=HP01CH14M02E class=break>So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Wonder what it&#8217;s like to have a peaceful life,&#8221; Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It&#8217;s hatching.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn&#8217;t hear of it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got lessons, we&#8217;ll get into trouble, and that&#8217;s nothing to what Hagrid&#8217;s going to be in when someone finds out what he&#8217;s doing &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; Harry whispered.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn&#8217;t like the look on Malfoy&#8217;s face at all.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid&#8217;s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.
