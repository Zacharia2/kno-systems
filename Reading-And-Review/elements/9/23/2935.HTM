<P id=HP01CH14M01S class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never remember this,&#8221; Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they&#8217;d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry, who was looking up &#8220;Dittany&#8221; in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn&#8217;t look up until he heard Ron say, &#8220;Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Jus&#8217; lookin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. &#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;re you lot up ter?&#8221; He looked suddenly suspicious. &#8220;Yer not still lookin&#8217; fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,&#8221; said Ron impressively. &#8220;And we know what that dog&#8217;s guarding, it&#8217;s a Sorcerer&#8217;s St &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Shhhh!&#8221; Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. &#8220;Don&#8217; go shoutin&#8217; about it, what&#8217;s the matter with yeh?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;about what&#8217;s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;SHHHH!&#8221; said Hagrid again. &#8220;Listen &#8212; come an&#8217; see me later, I&#8217;m not promisin&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell yeh anythin&#8217;, mind, but don&#8217; go rabbitin&#8217; about it in here, students aren&#8217; s&#8217;pposed ter know. They&#8217;ll think I&#8217;ve told yeh &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;See you later, then,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Hagrid shuffled off.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;What was he hiding behind his back?&#8221; said Hermione thoughtfully.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?&#8221;
