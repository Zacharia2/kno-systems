<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to see what section he was in,&#8221; said Ron, who&#8217;d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Dragons!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper&#8217;s Guide.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid&#8217;s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But it&#8217;s against our laws,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks&#8217; Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It&#8217;s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we&#8217;re keeping dragons in the back garden &#8212; anyway, you can&#8217;t tame dragons, it&#8217;s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie&#8217;s got off wild ones in Romania.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But there aren&#8217;t wild dragons in Britain?&#8221; said Harry.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Of course there are,&#8221; said Ron. &#8220;Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who&#8217;ve spotted them, to make them forget.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;So what on earth&#8217;s Hagrid up to?&#8221; said Hermione.</P>

<P id=HP01CH14M02S class=break>When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper&#8217;s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
