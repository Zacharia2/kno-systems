<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren&#8217;t you, Hagrid?&#8221; said Harry anxiously. &#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Not a soul knows except me an&#8217; Dumbledore,&#8221; said Hagrid proudly.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s something,&#8221; Harry muttered to the others. &#8220;Hagrid, can we have a window open? I&#8217;m boiling.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, Harry, sorry,&#8221; said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Hagrid &#8212; what&#8217;s <I class=calibre9>that</I>?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, &#8220;That&#8217;s &#8212; er&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Where did you get it, Hagrid?&#8221; said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. &#8220;It must&#8217;ve cost you a fortune.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Won it,&#8221; said Hagrid. &#8220;Las&#8217; night. I was down in the village havin&#8217; a few drinks an&#8217; got into a game o&#8217; cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;But what are you going to do with it when it&#8217;s hatched?&#8221; said Hermione.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve bin doin&#8217; some readin&#8217;,&#8221; said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. &#8220;Got this outta the library &#8212; Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit &#8212; it&#8217;s a bit outta date, o&#8217; course, but it&#8217;s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, &#8217;cause their mothers breathe on &#8217;em, see, an&#8217; when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o&#8217; brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An&#8217; see here &#8212; how ter recognize diff&#8217;rent eggs &#8212; what I got there&#8217;s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They&#8217;re rare, them.&#8221;
