<P></P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game&#8217;s over! Harry&#8217;s won! We&#8217;ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!&#8221; shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn&#8217;t believe it. He&#8217;d done it &#8212; the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped &#8212; then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore&#8217;s smiling face.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. &#8220;Nice to see you haven&#8217;t been brooding about that mirror&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. been keeping busy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. excellent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Snape spat bitterly on the ground.</P>
<P class=break>Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn&#8217;t ever remember feeling happier. He&#8217;d really done something to be proud of now &#8212; no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He&#8217;d done it, he&#8217;d shown Snape.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P id=HP01CH13M02S class=epubfirstparagraph>And speaking of Snape&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry&#8217;s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure&#8217;s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner &#8212; what was going on?
