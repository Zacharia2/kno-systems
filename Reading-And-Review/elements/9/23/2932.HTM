<P></P>
<P id=HP01CH13M02E class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>The trees were so thick he couldn&#8217;t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn&#8217;t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn&#8217;t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. d-don&#8217;t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Oh, I thought we&#8217;d keep this private,&#8221; said Snape, his voice icy. &#8220;Students aren&#8217;t supposed to know about the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone, after all.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid&#8217;s yet?&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;B-b-but Severus, I &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,&#8221; said Snape, taking a step toward him.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t know what you &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;You know perfectly well what I mean.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, &#8220;&#8212; your little bit of hocus-pocus. I&#8217;m waiting.&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;B-but I d-d-don&#8217;t &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Snape cut in. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have another little chat soon, when you&#8217;ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.&#8221;
