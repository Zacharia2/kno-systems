<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He&#8217;d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker&#8217;s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn&#8217;t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn&#8217;t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;The Potters, that&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s what I heard &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>&#8220;&#8212; yes, their son, Harry &#8212;&#8221;</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn&#8217;t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn&#8217;t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He&#8217;d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn&#8217;t blame her &#8212; if he&#8217;d had a sister like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but all the same, those people in cloaks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P>
<P class=epubfirstparagraph>He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o&#8217;clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
